

Tell the gents we have a passenger.


Quickly!


Really hot.


We can't work under these conditions. You guys should
complain to your union.


This is South Africa, everything is a political matter.


These balaclavas, are they standard protocol?


Because I didn't get one.


They're obviously not bullet proof. You know that, right?


So you've got the bulletproof vest, but if they shoot you
through the head...


Guys, we've been driving for eight minutes.


I told you the thing is...


it has to be updated every...


every 15 minutes.


It's got a cash to crypto converter and if that thing
becomes corrupt...


So how far are we now?


No, wait, wait, I need that phone. I need to update these
codes.


Sit still, sir.


That's a lot of aggression for this early in the morning.


Woah! Woah! Woah! Woah! Woah!


Woah, what is this?


What is happening here? Where are we?


- Driver!
- Shut Up!


Oh, sorry.


Please!


Please, sir.


Sir, please. Please.


Get out!


Open up!


Open up!


Hey you, Mr MIT.


If you play around, you'll end up a dead dog.


- Yes.
- Do you hear me?


I get it, I understand.


I understand.


- Relax, and you do as you're told.
- I'm relaxed, I'm relaxed.


- Yes.
- I swear I'm relaxed.


It's just...


You guys leave your guns in here.


You're cool right?


Cool.


Let go of him.


- Alright, everybody out.
- Woah.


Out, out.


- Mmini it's me.
- Okay, sure Tshepo?


- Get the bags.

Get the bags!


Get those people out. Out!


Hey, Bra Snake.


- Hey, piss off!

Piss off, we're working here!


Fuck!


Relax, they're my people. They're with me.

Where is it?


It's...


Where is it?


Just...


We...


We put it here to keep it safe.


It's...


It's right here, sir.


- Come and collect the money.
- Get the money.


Get the money! Get the money! Get the money!


Let's go men!


- Piss off, we're working here.
- Bra Snake, will you give me 50 - 50?


- Piss off.
- No, man.


Hey, fancy face. Come here.


- Come here.
- Sorry, sorry.


- Stand here, stand here. Keep quiet.
- I know nothing.


Get the money there!


Pack the money, pack the money. Collect the money!


- Collect the money.

Collect the money dammit! Turn around!


- Take this.
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!


- You know Mmini...
- Quick! Quick!


- Relax. Bring the money.
- Pass, pass!


Hurry up, hurry up, quick!


Let's go, let's go.


Stand back.


Bra Snake.


I told you this was going to be easy.


Fuck man! We're working here.


- Piss off!
- Bra Snake, what's the matter now?


Piss off!


Bra Snake, why are you doing this to me? I gave you the
route.


Line them up.


Sir, I just want to say, if you can maybe help me, just to
get out because...


- Get out.
- I don't even know, I know nothing of this.


I have no idea what you are saying.


- What are you saying exactly?
- This money was not logged.


You guys can go. I don't know any of you.


Okay, me and you are speaking at the same time now. Who has
the gun? Me.


Yes sir.


- Yes, I have the gun.
- Bra Snake.


- We're all in this together, right Bra Snake?
- Hey Ubsuku!


Yes, we're working but we are in this together, right?


Bra Snake!


Here's another one.


Here's another one.


- No, please.
- Here's another one.


Hey, get the money, to give him his cut.


- Stand there.
- Please, I don't know anything.


- That money is not even logged.
- Give him his cut.


You guys can get away with it.
Nobody will even know about it.


- Give him his cut.
- Please just let me go man, I've got a family sir.


I've got three children.


- I don't want your money. I swear.
- Take your money, man!


- I swear to God...
- Take your money.


It's not the money. I don't, I just want to go home.


- Listen here.
- I want to go home.


- Take your money.
- Please Sir.


Take your money.


We're all here to work and hustle.


I don't want the money. I just want to go home.


- You know very well, we're all hustling.
- I won't... I never saw your face.


I don't want it!


Hey, how's it going my people?


Damn hey...


If you're surprised by this, then you're not from Mzansi.


T.I.S.A. my brothers.


This is South Africa. This is not the States.


The proof is in the witnessing of these top-notch criminals


that have just unleashed hellfire for the crypto converter
and our money.


Money that was meant to come to us, for the people.


To convert it into Kasi Dolla, a Crypto currency for the
hood by the hood.


But look at this mess now.


But this is nothing for the people in the hood.


If you can make it here, you can make it anywhere.


Anyways, I am Rego and I am rolling with my
gang called Kasi Green Tech.


You'll meet them "soon, soon" like
"now, now" but a little later.


In the meantime, watch our story closely.


Top of the morning SA, and welcome to Morning News Live.

What does the world of sports have to hold for us this
weekend?


Good Morning, my people. I'm feeling great.


And yes of course, I am the King of it all and sports is my
side hustle.


My people I have the highlights from last night's Europa
Champion's League game.


On top of that, a schedule for this weekend's upcoming
games.


Hey!


Wake up!


In our headlines for this morning...

to build Africa's first nuclear power station.

Speaking of Tech For Township tender case, a businessman

Let's get to it, Nori.


Thank you, Dorothy.


Now, very truly, I tell you...


Now, very truly, I tell you...


it's not very often that one is allowed to traverse the very
same hostel corridors...


classes and halls that used to be home to some very famous
alma mater.


Now, you know them as the Molemanes.


Now, you know them as the Molemanes.


But I've come to find out that here today they're more
affectionately known as...


The Triple O's!


That's right. Triple O's.


Now that's all from me for now, my name Naroshian Reddy.


And I'm coming to you live from Grenville High in
Johannesburg.


Cut.


- Can we go get a couple of other shots?
- Yes, sir.


- Guys, will you come with me?
- Yes, sir.


Great, let's go.


Thank you.


That's us.


In any power circle, they know us as The Triple O's.


Middle centre is Pitso.


Left is Kagiso, and on the right is me, Regomoditso.


We are the Molemanes.


These two coming out...


are Andrew 'Druza' Lesilo and Dwayne Van Niekerk...


"My brother's keeper" who both come from very rich families.


Untill today, they're our lawyers.


The merchandise.


In matric, we pulled a heist on our rugby coach
through bribes...


for a piece of his profit from the sales of steroids.


With that money, we bought school uniforms for the less
fortunate students.


Daddy's hero! I told you that...


Please stop.


Don't mind all of that! These people know nothing my child.


This is my hero!


You are our future!


You'll show us the way, my hero!


That's our pride!


Let's go, gentlemen.


From way back then, the gang and I have always wanted to be
ghetto superheroes, you see.


Fighter for the people, my friend.


We like to call ourselves the Good-deed-doers.


That's what we learned from our grandma.


She always said,
"treat everyone how you would like to be treated."


[Crying]


You never know in whose life you're planting a seed...


whose tree will shade your future
from the harsh sun rays of life.


Damn, grandma...


number one good Samaritan of Moria.


Who, despite life's turmoil...


raised us up with love.


Until that fatal day.


It was just like yesterday.


So grandma Joyce was a victim of forced housing removal.


At the dawn of the new democracy...


Grandma continuously applied to get her house back.


Damn.


I guess this time the land's court rejection
hit her the hardest.


All she wanted was to see out her last days
in the same house


she lost her husband to a police raid, in.


- Help! Help!
- Grandma. Grandma!


- Help!
- Grandma!


Grandma!


Help!


Help!


But you know how it goes...


out of the blue of our sky...


from the depths of our sea.


You can't successfully make an
honest living in this South Africa of ours.


Review Board Members, what's going on?


Review Board Members, what's going on?


Why are you dragging your feet?


It's been a month since the judge's recommendation to
award the tender...


to Kasi Green Tech instead of Rekisa Ditchaba.


To Kasi Green Tech instead of Rekisa Ditchaba.


Who you initially awarded it to.


You complain when we do things quickly...


and you complain when we take our time
to resolve this matter.


Please let us do our jobs correctly, allow us.


This process will take a day or two.


A day or two. Processes, processes, processes.


A day or two. Processes, processes, processes.


We are sick and tired of the process.


You puppets, this is another way of
looting taxpayers' money.


You puppets, this is another way of

We, the people, we demand a Kasi Dolla.

A proudly South African cryptocurrency...


A proudly South African cryptocurrency...


made for the hood by the hood.


- Power!
- Ours!


- Power!
- Ours!


Ours!


We are sick and tired of white monopoly
capital always demanding.


You guys aren't serious.


This government is going to fail us.


Piss off, man, rubbish!


Two days before the review process reached its end...


we got a 16V through pass from an anonymous source.


We had no choice but to 'Themba Zwane' this situation.


This tender review is a farce.


A decoy for the old guard to buy enough time...


to heist the first 50 million tranche
of the one billion bid.


Stellies Bosch, major shareholder of Moleya Holdings
and his cronies...


plan to funnel all the money into building nuclear power
plants to power their IPPs.


But in order for that to happen,
they need to displace at least...


60 percent of the township population.


Follow my instruction in the package and we might just
revolutionise the township.


One kasi dolla at a time.


Moleya Holdings and their handlers...


were going to do to the people of the township now...


what the dark days did to our Grandma twice.


We had to save the hood from Stellies Bosch and the Eastern
threat Wong Kar Wei Constructions.


This became personal.


Sir, we don't have all day. Open up.


We don't have all day. What's going on?


There's a strike today gentlemen.


What's this? You say your name is 'Strike' and 'Strike' has
done what now?


Bathu Pele Special Security,
we protect people in of case emergencies.


Who are you and what do you want?


If I were you, I wouldn't go in.


Do you see this badge? It is above your life and pay grade.


- Okay, Okay.
- Open the gate!


- Make it snappy.
- Telling me shit here.


Open Sesame.


Yes, yes!


They just got in!


Here we are, boys.


Let's enjoy this money!


Hey, Mmusi.


Whatever.


Take this bag and put it in the car.


Okay, cool.


- Okay.
- Today is payday.


Put it inside. Are you afraid of money?


Look, look, look!


Look.


That's Ntombi from Six.


Our 'Themba Zwane' to stock sweets, 'Doctor Khumalo'...


you guys haven't done anything.


Look at how tired he is.


I'm tired.


Here's the money!


Bring it here.


Hey, gents! There's trouble. Quick!


Quick, come hurry up guys! Let's get moving man!


Let's go! Let's go!


Guys the money!


Listen my boy, don't start something
you won't be able to finish.


Grave diggers don't dig their own grave.


My boys will find you wherever you are.


Many comrades thought the rainbow nation
will treat them well.


The government's enemies are my enemies
until the end of time.


Take the bags filled with money. Deposit it in different
banks... ATMs everywhere!


You have to do it in 14 hours.


We don't have time.
Otherwise, the algorithm will be corrupted.


- Can you do this for me?
- I got you.


You got me? Let's do it. Cool.


One down. 50 million to go.


99 problems but a Snake is not one.


Our plan was to go back to the headquarters in Soweto.


Where we would wait for the workers to deposit the money
from different ATM's and banks.


Then launch Kasi Dolla. The Crypto to liberate the hood!


- Okay, I've got it. Let's go to Soweto.
- Alright, let's go.


Can't you drive any faster?


- I'm going fast.
- Go.


Calling 10:2, I repeat.


Calling a 10:2!


Calling on all units, within the Johannesburg CBD district.


To track down and find the assailants
who were seen leaving the scene...


In a 202 Toyota Quantum, blue.


Number plates are: RNK 003 GP.


All units will shut the city down today.


These men are a high priority target in possession of 50
million rands in cash.


State property.


They must face the full extent of our law.


I told you guys not to go in.


Fuck off man! Piss off!


Gents, we're shutting the city down today, let's go.


- Hey, Bra, look at this.
- Okay, sure.


Hey guys! Watch the social hashtags, you're trending, gents


- It's another message.
- What did they say?


The number is not the same,
but it has the same lollipop emoji.


Take a look.


Don't tell me about these people. These people sending us
messages are the one's setting us up.


No way, everything went well.


We got the money, didn't we?


Yes, we did.


Oh shit!


- What?
- They're saying it's us.


We didn't do this.


Fuck! They're lying about us again.


The police are on the lookout and on very high alert...


for a blue Toyota Quantum.


Registration number RNK 003 GP...


last seen here at the scene of the crime on the corner
Centenary and the R25...


last seen here at the scene of the crime on the corner
Centenary and the R25...


getting away scot-free with 50 mill...


That's correct, people. 50 million rand.


It's a bloody big pay day, if you ask me.


I'm Naroshian Reddy, back to you.


This, ladies and gentlemen...


is the heart-breaking sight of self-hatred.


People who commit such atrocities have no place in our
rainbow nation.


My goodness, this is a movie.


It's a total shutdown on the highway.


It's a total shutdown on the highway.


There is nowhere to hide for the 50 million carrying
perpetrators.


The police have closed off the M1 south near the N2
intersection...


The police have closed off the M1 south
near the N2 intersection...


and the M2 is closed off towards the Marlboro off-ramp.


And the M2 is closed off towards the Marlboro off-ramp.


And the M2 is closed off towards the Marlboro off-ramp.


And the M2 is closed off towards the Marlboro off-ramp.


After closing the N3, the N2 will also be shutdown.


Hopefully all these roadblocks end up being effective.


- And not because they're wasting taxpayers' money.
- Fuck, they know what car we are in.


- We'll be back shortly.
- We have to dump it.


- What?
- We have to dump the vehicle.


Guys, we need to get off the highway ASAP!


We're sitting ducks waiting to be snapped by the e-toll.


How?


All routes leading to Soweto are closed.


No ways.


Oh shit...


Oh, we're in shit.


Listen...


this means we cannot go to HQ...


which means no data mine and we can't launch the currency.


- Fuck!
- To launch, all we need to do is to log into the main frame


mobile and then install the program.


Yeah, and then and then... which means that when the
networks link, then we can upload the algorithm...


then we can launch from anywhere.


Yes, yes.


Okay, then the highway it is.


Okay.


- Okay, we're good, right?
- Fuck! The cops.


- Where?
- The police.


- Shit!
- Fuck!


Fuck!


This is not supposed to be happening.


How the hell did we not know that Snake,
ex-special force, is involved?


The people who are feeding you information


are feeding you all the wrong information.


Now they're going to frame us for a crime we didn't even do.


Don't we have other offices that we provide services to?


- Yeah.
- Yeah.


So? What are you insinuating?


I'm saying let's go to the
Wynberg offices and launch it there.


We don't know what might happen,
but we chose to be servants of the people.


So we have to do it now, right?


Go all the way. 'Cause we're all we've got.


If we launch this thing,
at least there can be a win-win for the people.


- No matter what our predicament is.
- Yes.


Sure.


- Let's do this.
- Sure.


Shit!


Look there.


Reverse! Reverse!


- Reverse!
- Yes, I'm reversing!


Reverse!


What are you waiting for? Go!


- Go, go!
- I'm going. I'm going, I'm going!


- Go still!
- Just go!


- Go, go, go!
- They're getting closer!


Fuck! Where are they?


Okay!


- I think we lost them.
- No, no, no, no!


- We lost them?
- Hurry up bra! Hurry up!


Go, go, go, go!


We'll be right back.


Alright, thank you company. Let's make the 40-second call.


Why were we vomiting out vital information...


that could deter the gang's capture?


Sorry?


Don't speak to me like that, Aunty.


If I didn't, we wouldn't be trending on the social streets.


You know me. I'm all about the bag.


So much make-up, cover up.


Learn to love yourself...


instead of chasing bags, influencer.


Oh, shame, "Rock".


I am from the township. I run all the townships.


Five...


four...


three...


two...


one...


and...


Welcome back to Morning News Live.


All units suspected Quantum spotted
leading into Alexandra township.


Sister, I was right on that spot.


A fidelity came from that direction.


A man stopped the car and a couple men surrounded it, and I
saw guns.


Did you see any faces?


I can't say I did, I was already in the bushes.


Tshepo saw a man take out a big gun and start shooting.


7.62mm calibre, must have been shot out of an AK-47.


Hello, baby.


Long time, no see.


Jacky...


Yes?


Can you please see which one of our friends this was shot
out of?


This wild goose chase is two years in... and


still nothing.


He was never convicted for the
brutal murder of your partner.


Just do the forensics.


If it's him, it's fucking him. If it's not, it's not.


Fine, fine.


Please take this through.


Cappie...


they've got these fuckers locked down, surrounded in
Alexandra, of all places.


Perfect.


Go!


Cheers.


All units. Calling all units.


I repeat, all units.


Now that we have these fucking bastards cornered, nobody
shoot to kill. You hear me?


Nobody shoot to kill. I want to take these fuckers alive.


These fuckers are running around with Russian bullets...


which means they've got ruskie guns on my streets and I want
to know what their source is.


You can tell that fucking Mokwepa Zondo that he doesn't have
the authority to close down my city.


Do you hear me?


Fuckers!


Copy, Cappie, copy.


Alright, let's go!


Mmini!


Yes!


Mmini!


Yes!


Please man.


Please brother!


Please.


Please.


Please.


Please.


Hands in the air.


No, man.


Ha, ah.


Don't you dare touch me.


I'll bust your head open.


Please come over, Frikkie. It's urgent, there is trouble.


What fucking trouble?


Snake is here.


I'm coming.


MK number one and two.


And it does not stand for Mkhonto We Sizwe.


You fucked up real good this time, right friend?


I'm not your friend.


You're right. I'm not your fucking friend.


Listen here.


We're looking for Lesilo.


It's boss to you, you dumb fuck.


You never call him by his name. Do you understand?


Bring it on old man, come!


Easy there.


It's okay, friend.


Come, fuckers.


Come now you big mouths.


Talk all that shit now.


Boss, Boss.


Boss, it's urgent.


Frikkie!


You disturbed my me time. For what now man?


Fuck!


Come, fuck, talk.


Sir...


Yeah, man. There was a problem at the factory.


We were ambushed.


Yes, my brother.


There was a strike which started from nowhere.


They took the money and the launcher case.


It can't be the Alex boys because they would've killed us.


Someone is selling us out here.


I think it's the Kasi Dolla Boys.


Frikkie, please.


There's someone they're working with from the inside.


We could interrogate your son Druza, to get some answers.


That 50 million...


was my buy-in to the one billion rand...


nuclear power station construction that's happening in the
townships.


That was supposed to be my stake.


Now, I don't care who took that money.


And neither do my partners.


What we care about is that you get it back...


before Wong Kar Wei...


decides that he'd rather give that nuclear
technology to the Kenyans.


My brothers and I realised a long time ago that the
establishment needed to be fucked with.


Better life for all of us, type of vibes, not just a few.


Who's your friend now, friend?


Stand up, douche. Come.


Move, fuck.


You've been a very bad boy...


and you must be punished.


[Phone Ringing] "Stellies Bosch".


Fuck.


- Shit, shit!
- Get out of the motor vehicle with your hands up!


Put on your mask.


Why? They already know us.


- Get out of the motor vehicle or we'll shoot!
- Fuck!


This is your final warning!


Get out of the motor vehicle now!


- This is your final warning!
- Dude, I think we should listen to them.


And get out and just surrender. Okay, these guys are about
to fucking shoot at us.


Great idea Vin Diesel. But we didn't get this far, for us to
to get arrested now!


Kill the fucking engine!


Now! Or we'll shoot!


Dude, what other choice do we have?


What other choice do we have?


You never...


What other choice do we have?


Pitso!


Drive, Pitso!


I'm going, I'm going, I'm going!


- Go to the next lane. Go this side, this side!
- I'm trying to go in!


Okay.


Okay, so I think we've lost them.


- No, no, no.
- We lost them.


We lost them. Go, go, go!


This is Alpha one, we found the vehicle.


It's empty, no sign of the suspects.


Pitso here, please leave a message.


Our initial application didn't have a cryptocurrency...


which is what was primarily required.


But we are well capable of creating an innovative Tech
economy for the township.


With our cryptocurrency Green Label
launching this coming Tuesday.


Which now completes our bid.


Your podium, Mr Lesilo.


As you know by now, sirs...


before we broke away and started Kasi Green Tech...


we used to work as interns at Moleya Holdings Data Security.


Which later became known as Rekisa Ditchaba.


And that crypto Matama is talking about...


is the exact same reason why we decided to break away.


We worked on its foundation.


It was never built to benefit the user...


but the manufacturer.


Exactly like a bank.


With Kasi Dolla, we want to financially empower


the hood away from exploitative third parties.


Kasi Dolla wants to give everyone an equal opportunity to
create wealth...


for themselves...


and this is how.


Most recent statistics show that
upwards of six billion rand...


entered Soweto with workers from the township,


and almost none of it stayed there.


Kasi Dolla is a cryptocurrency,


a mobile money used within the township


that reduces transaction costs for users.


Kasi Dolla will facilitate growth of
every township business...


and individual by creating an insulated...


You can tell that fucking Mokwepa Zondo


that he doesn't have the authority


to close down my city.


Do you hear me?


Hey.


Are you done with your nonsense?


I just bought us some time in there, so we can fix this.


You should be thanking me.


Okay, call the gents and tell them we'll meet in Alex.


Shit!


Fuck!


You see now.


Now that Wynberg is out,


we need to get out of Alex before they shut it down.


Yes.


Look, the first thing we need to do is get the
cryptocurrency launched, right?


This is 50 million.


50 million is national treasury shit. This is security shit.


I know we're supposed to go to Soweto, but there's no way we
can get there right now.


You heard the lady on the news. All the highways are blocked
by now.


Let's go to Main Street and find an internet cafe in Alex...


and launch the codes from there,
once the money has been deposited.


It's only going to get deposited by the end of the day.


You can't expect us to wonder around in
Alex with a bag full of money.


And a crypto converter.


Genius plan.


Okay.


Alright.


Uhm...


I don't know.


It's 50 million, I can't get them to deposit it all at once.


You know what I'm saying?
So the latest that they can do is 8pm.


8pm? It's 3pm right now.


That's five hours from now.


Call Tshepiso and tell them to get them to hurry.


How do I get them to hurry? These are factory workers,
Pitso.


Just do it, Kagiso.


We must get a laptop that is capable of
launching Kasi Dolla...


then we can lay low until eight o'clock.


What?


What are you saying?


We can't do that. We need to get out of Alex right now


go into Soweto.
That's the only way we can smuggle out of here.


- That's the dumbest thing I've heard today.
- What?


With police blocking each and every way out?
Looking for one, two, three assailants!


- Okay, guys.
- Well you're dumb. You know what? You're dumb!


Hey!


Alright? You've both made good points.


Okay, but we need to get out of here ASAP,
but we can't right now.


He's right.


There are roadblocks, after roadblocks, after roadblocks.


Okay?


This is one billion. It's the Gupta gang.
It's no child's play.


Okay?


Guys, look, at least the one thing
that we do know is that...


the money will be deposited eventually, right?


So for now, we just lay low, we...


we blend in.


And whenever we can, we launch the Dolla. Okay?


We're too far down the rabbit hole. We're up to here.


There's no turning back. Please, guys.


Head strong.


- Head strong, please.
- Yes.


Thank you.


Hey, Pitso.


Will any laptop work?


We need one that's compatible.


Kagiso, let's go, man!


Come on, come on!


Captain, the results are in. You're right, it's a match.


Really?


Fucking fantastic!


We're catching a Snake today.


If he resists, you do whatever we can to take him down.


Copy. We're on our way to Alexandra station.


There's a sergeant waiting for us there.
He's going to brief us on the situation.


Oh, sorry, Captain.


I didn't know it was you. My mistake.


Take my numbers.


If Mokwepa Zondo shows up here or crosses any of these
stops, you call me.


You don't chirp it on the fucking radio, okay?


- Okay, copy, Captain.
- Alright.


Let's grab a couple in celebration.


Before the southern Friday traffic dies down...


then we can head to HQ and...


give the good news to the Triple O's.


Yeah, that's if they're still not stuck in traffic.


The Review Board Members are still here.


By the looks of things,
this day did not go how they had expected.


Nope.


We apologise to cut off the chase as helicopters circle...


but we are now joined by Sam...


who'll be giving us an overview of
what is happening with the economy.


Sam, is there anything as exciting as high speed chases on
the market streets today?


Well, the market is a high speed chase all of its own.


Normally chasing its own tail.


Bra Sam, geez.


But the real challenge we face right now is the push from
the private sector...


that government commits to the one billion rand...


that they've invested with international corporations...


who will build nuclear power stations and
frack the wild coast.


My goodness, I hear you talking about
fracking and hacking of township removals.


I mean, where are they going to build those nuclear plants?


And what happens when we lose?
I mean, the rich get richer...


and what will happen to the poor people?
Will they go to the townships?


Now that the weapon of their
financial freedom was in our servant hands...


the people had no idea what we were about to save them from.


Shit, shit.


Come, come.


Come!


I ordered 35 crates not 25.


So what's going on?


Greetings, Baba.


Wait a minute, I'm busy here...


what, did you drink them?


Excuse me, take out your cellphone and call the head office.


That's not our problem.


Our job is to make sure the truck is loaded and we deliver.


- Okay.
- Baba, I'm from Kasi Green Tech.


We installed your solar panel and lights.


We make sure the township is fine.


- Green Tech?
- Yes.


Bab'Mkhize!


Wait, I know you kids.


Wait, wait.


Revolutionising the township one bit at a time.


It's me. Let me assist you with your stock deliveries and
I'll set up your app.


Hey, Bab'Mkhize!


What's going on here?


What's the matter with you?


Leave me alone man!


Bab' Mkhize.


You need to pay me the money you owe me.


Bab' Mkhize, what did I say about embarrassing me in public!


You're lucky I'm hunting down real criminals who stole
50 million rand today.


Otherwise I would arrest all of you.


You listen to me, Mokwepa,
you get the money and Stellies's crypto launcher...


before Wong Kar Wei gets a sniff that we messed this up!


You get it?


My brother, don't you worry. We will fix this.


Bye.


Damn.


What did he say?


He doesn't understand me.


Aren't the gents knocking off?


I don't know, I told them to come here.


Where are they?


Check with them.


Here they are.


Oh, about time.


- Sir.
- Yes.


Did you hide the gun?


Did you hide the gun?


Yes.


Okay, we'll need it later. We have a plan.


Fuck!


Gents, these people screwed us.


We have to go after them, no matter what.


They did us dirty.


We have to show all these Joburg thugs what we're made of.


Okay?


Let's go, gents.


My boy, the boss.


That means I'll get my three missing crates, right?


- Yes sir.
- Three days?


- Three days.
- Free of charge?


Free of charge, Bab'Mkhize. Goodbye.


There we go. Take care.


Good boy.


Fuck!


I couldn't launch it, his line is twenty-five Mbps,


we need at least two hundred and fifty upwards.


The police haven't left.


No, friend, you'll find us there.


We're going to Bab'Mkhize's Tavern.


Me too.


Shit, I told you this plan isn't going to work.


Is there a way out of here?


Don't be upset. I'm telling you.


You have a Detective here with you.


This way.


Let's go. Go, go.


It's them...


Hey! Hey!


Hey!


Hey! Open the gate!


Hey! Hey!


You'd better have a good reason to be
banging my door like that.


There are suspects running through your yard. Open the gate.


Everyone here, are my employees.


I won't open without a warrant.


Bab'Mkhize, open the gate.


You're confusing me.


There are many criminals around Alexandra.


There are only good people in here.


Alexandra is King Tha's territory.


Not that cupcake of yours that keeps deploying you every
time the people rebel.


I won't open this gate without a warrant of arrest,
do you hear me?


Bab'Mkhize, I'll get you.


I'm Mavovo, you don't know. I'm Khabazela.


Geez, this is nonsense.


Wait, get the bag.


Okay, take the money and don't act suspicious.


Okay, cool.


Okay, let's go.


Now that the SAPS have shut down Alexandra township,
no way in or out.


To violent resistance from taxi drivers...


because today is the anniversary of their slain taxi boss...


William "Can't Touch" Matheba.


Hey you!


Get busy with something. What's your problem? Take this.


And this lockdown disturbs the peace.


And then?


Who are you people?


What do you want here?


Hmm?


- Bab'Mkhize...
- Mkhize?


...for a blue Toyota Quantum.


Registration number, RNK 003...


What do you want?


Mkhize, Mkhize...


Mkhize?


...getting away scot-free, with 50 million rand...


It's needed. This is definitely needed.


Come closer, man.


Don't block the TV. What's wrong with you?


Attention!


Salute!


Bring your tithes and offerings and let me bless you like
how the blessers do the ladies.


Four, three...


two...


one!


I'm so happy, my guys.


You see now.


I need to get into heists as well.


There's 50 million in the township.


What's going on here?


Who are these people, do you know them?


And now?


Break down walls and jump fences,
who are you people in my yard?


What do you want? What do you have for me?


- We have nothing for you.
- What?


We're just passing through, sorry.


And the bag?


There's nothing in it.


What do you mean there's nothing in it?


No, there's nothing.


Where are you from?


Get them, dammit!


Go after those bastards!


Hey this way!


Kagiso, this way!


There they are!


Let's go!


Shit!


Let's go the other way!


But Bab'Mkhize...


he's going to confront me about my bill
as if I'm one of these alcoholics?


He's telling me nonsense.


He's really telling me nonsense.


I'll show him.


Hey! Stop running, there are cars around.


Bab'Mkhize, though.


Hey!


Hey!


Hey!


Hey!


Guys, wait. Woah, woah!


I think...


Shit, I knew this plan wouldn't work.


Now everyone is coming after us.


Would you relax, just a little please!


There is a bigger play here. We need to play our part.


Who do you think you're talking to?


You think I'm one of these kids you work with?


- These people are trying to fucking kill us!
- Guys, wait. Look.


Listen, okay?


Those guys split up, okay?


If we go that way, we'll probably bump into them.


I think it's better if we just...


if we go around this way.


Listen here, Rego.


You Rego, must just shut up!


Shut up. You're talking nonsense.


I'm going to go to the head office and


I'm going to start launching this thing! Give it!


- That's not the fucking plan!
- Give it to me.


That's not the fucking plan!


You're going to tell me about the fucking plan right now?!


You're going to tell me about the fucking plan right now?!


I don't want to listen to your fucking plan!


Kagiso, stop!


- Yho! That is enough!
- No, don't tell me about the plan!


- Kagiso!
- Fuck you!


- Get her off, of me!
- Kagiso!


Get off me!


Kagiso! That is it!


Enough!


Are you serious right now?


Really, guys? We're fighting right now?


In our time? In our moment?


Think about Grandma. Is that what Grandma would've wanted?


What would Grandma have wanted?
Would she have wanted this?


Guys, please get your heads together.


- Especially you.
- Talk to her.


You see now?


Fuck, Kagiso!


Kagiso, come on!


Kagiso!


- Are you okay, dude?
- I'm not okay dog.


Fuck, where is she?


- Where did she go?
- I don't know, but we need to find her.


It's not safe here.


Hello, hello, hello!


Where are you going, my sister?


- Let go of me!
- Come here!


Come here!


Kagiso!


Stelen Jakobus Boschendal AKA Stellies Bosch.


Boss of all bosses, last number stunner.
King of the gangsters!


Needed Snake to succeed so,
no Kasi Dolla, and to keep the hood impoverished.


So if we could financially empower the hood,
they could buy it back from those dogs.


Mr Wong.


Hmm.


The meal you prepared for me is very impressive.


I have to hand it to whoever told you.


This is my type of fine dining.


Touché.


But first, you said your government would
match our one billion rand offer.


That when the public outcry stopped that,
you said you'd make a plan.


Well the plan has failed.


We're going with Kenya.


They pay before the time.


Guess the...


Kenyan idiots are used to early ejaculation.


No wonder their offspring jumps up and down...


popping up all over the place like little, Jacks in the box.


How about I sweeten the deal?


A cryptocurrency.


Mau's People's Republic has all the crypto I need.


China, my China doesn't have cryptocurrency
for the hood by the hood.


Fucking bastards.


The whole of Africa is a township...


and you will be the landlord for their economic freedom.


You're so beautiful, sister.


You look like a doll.


Mabuza, relax. You can never win here.


Here? I'm a cop, do you want to see my badge?


I'll buy you Ocean Basket.


I'm a Lieutenant.


Hey, hey.


Jackpot!


Bingo!


You guys said it's 50 million.
This is looking like one million.


- Where's the rest of it?
- Hey, where's the rest?


Where's the money?


Jabu, relax, my man.


This one is for you untill the heat dies down, relax.


I need you, my boy. Pay your debts.


And you? You're my boss now?


- Huh?
- Woah. Hey, relax.


Don't forget you owe Bab'Mkhize.


You need to settle your debts, but look here, my boy...


I got you. Relax.


Just take this until the heat dies down.


Everything will be alright, okay?


Do you understand me?


- Kagiso, are you okay?
- Please get me out of here.


Kagiso, are you okay?


- I'm okay.
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!


Why am I being ignored?


It's a fuck up! It's a "Bantustan" call you now...


- Hi there, can I get a drink, man?
- Sure.


Thanks man.


You...


gay boy, your father is looking for you.


Come, walk!


You...


people...


you decide after everything we've discussed...


to award the tender to them.


You know, if Snake doesn't fix his fuck up...


we're all fucked.


All of us.


We only found out about Snake's fuck up after the decision
was signed, sealed and stamped sir.


We were following your orders.


No, fuck man.


You...


where are your trust fund thieving partners?


After everything I did for you.


After taking care of you by myself...


when your mother abandoned you.


You decide...


not to take my calls.


You don't answer my calls!


Dwayne and I handle the legal.


Not the Triple O's.


And my mom...


she didn't abandon me. She got murdered.


You do remember, right?


Same fucking difference.


Our last hope at getting a powerful enough
laptop to launch Kasi Dolla...


was with the township Green Tech solar panel electricians.


Who did scheduled maintenance every Friday,
in every hood we provided Green services to.


From 5-8pm


This is bullshit.


They're here.


I guess the roadblocks didn't stop them.


Let's go.


Look to your right.


And who are you guys?


What are you doing out here on the
street this time of the night?


Don't you know it's illegal to be here?


Boss, my name is Jeffrey from Kasi Green Tech.


We fix geysers and solar panels.


I gave these boys from Alex an opportunity to be employed.


And what do you have in there?


We have our equipment and overalls.


Come, show me.


Come.


Hey, get the crypto on the laptop and launch it.


Take it out.


- Shit!
- What?


It's on two percent.


Why didn't you take the charger?


I just saw the bag and the laptop.


How was I supposed to know there was no charger in there?


No, man. Fuck!


Now we have to go and find another charger.


Nkuruma Optics.


This laptop is not on the market yet.


Don't forget Andrew bought it from the Ghanaian guy.


One billion rand...


Hey, fuck.


Shit.


Let's search this house.


Nobody loses when the government plays its part, Dorothy.


I mean, we're talking job opportunities for all of the
unemployed youth in the township.


Not to mention, the township itself that
desperately needs a face lift.


There's plenty of land being occupied
illegally in the township.


There's plenty of land being occupied
illegally in the township.


So if Moleya Holdings goes in,
removes the illegal dwellings...


builds power plants and employs the legal ones,
I see no problem there.


You know the rate at which he'd sell his soul for money,
never ceases to amaze me.


I mean, the heist of the money coming into
his own son's company?


For them it's always money over blood.


Well, Kasi Dolla threatens their handler's
monopoly over the hood.


So...


Of course they would do
anything in their power to oppose it.


Too bad this time it failed.


I mean, this whole thing is about the IPP monopoly.


- You know it, right?
- Well...


You ever heard of a Mabetha Holdings?


They made most of their money from providing small services.


Totally unconnected.


They've got a make-up brand,
they control the Alexandra Workers Union...


and the Taxi Association UIFs...


And now a chunk of Kasi Green Tech shares...


have been purchased by a BDM of Mabetha Incorporated.


So it sent your stock price sky rocketing through the roof.


Come Monday, you might have a new majority shareholder.


One with a lot of money.


So, it's a biggy.


I mean, it's impressive, whoever they are.


That purchase got you listed.


Congratulations!


Kasi Green Tech is certified.


Listed on the JSE.


- Cape Town is next.
- Yes.


Yeah.


Too bad my mom isn't here to see the company that betrayed
her start to crumble, man.


Mom Fredwina is always with you.


Yeah.


As South Africans, we should really introspect...


and question everything we are being told.


If the private sector goes about doing as they please...


does government acquiesce our rights without our permission?


These bloody crypto Steve Biko's...


they're probably going to launch the Kasi Dolla program at
the data mine.


No, they can't launch it without the
converter that has the binding code...


and algorithm from Treasury, which is...


what those thieves have.


Some kind of fucking traffic to be stuck in.


Where are you guys?
In New York visiting Queen B or something?


Wait, wait what?


Right now?


What? What's going on?


Truth and a common struggle are great motivators...


and for any revolution to stand


against the well-oiled many faced dragon...


you need both.


So, we've got this package with
some information implicating...


your father, and the heist and Stellies.


Yeah, and in the theft of our money and uh, yho man...


and the death of your mother as well.


Yeah.


Let's go, guys.


When Andrew's mom...


Mam Fredwina found out the exact dealing
between Stellies and her...


struggle hero husband, Matthew.


She threatened to tell the leadership
of the party that she was a minister of.


So Matthew and Stellies came up with a plan...


and injected her with a severe case of avian influenza.


Which killed her instantly.


All Andrew needed was the truth.


Truth about the finer details surrounding his mother's
untimely passing.


Money's that were allocated for the upliftment of poor
black communities...


are now being ping ponged between public institutions.


Please for me...


for our viewers, please make it make sense...


Complimentary drinks for fellow rainbows and fairies.


We have a backlog when it comes to printing of notes.


We have to keep it moving.


We have to keep it moving.


On our side, there can't be sabotage.


We get orders and we follow.


You are implying that the sabotage is from us...


but you put in the transit order.


So you knew the routes, Johan.


You know the routes, Johan. You know the routes. Don't say
you don't know nothing


You know very well.


Treasury should know better about these matters


Treasury should know better about these matters


and these are the matters that...


- We know nothing.
- Definitely, people should know about.


We know nothing, your organisation should know.


Treasury has the money.


Let's go.


They know where the money went.


He's a corrupt cop.


And I'm offering him to you on a silver platter.


Look...


we're just pawns...


on the Queen's chest board, you and I.


I think we can certainly offer
each other an opportunity here.


Indeed.


Even I have to answer to the higher ups.


And getting rid of this corrupt cop
who is a thorn to both of us.


Well, it will buy us good standing with the establishment.


We must make sure we catch these guys...


- And recover the money.
- We need to make sure we've got all the bits fixed.


No cats, not even chickens will be allowed.


I just got off the phone with the Triple O's.


They're the ones who outsmarted you and your cronies.


That's them in Alex.


Surrounded on all sides,
and they have the money and converter.


I am their only way out of Alex.


Oh, good for you, smarty pants.


But how are you going to get into Alex?


The whole place is on lockdown.
No one gets in, no one gets out.


We have GP's most decorated policemen in our midst.


And he has a lot of making up to do.


In exchange, they're offering you the original
cut of the money.


What you stood to get had Snake and Co. not fucked up.


And the crypto converter?


They're going to square it with Stellies themselves...


and not mentioning your pay off to him.


Hey you!


You know, I didn't want you on this job...


but Stellies insisted, because you are his favourite Askari.


So I'm not paying for your fuck up.


Stellies is.


Listen here.


Can you get this boy into Alex using your badge?


We'll need some money in order to operate in Alex...


to buy time.


No problem.


Frikkie, in the boot, please.


Help this man in the boot, please.


- Dad.
- Huh?


I'm sorry that things turned out this way. I really wish
that we could have...


You really want to do this here and now, boy?


Hey, not you, Dwayne. Sit down.


Go, go, go, go, go!


Hey, boy, come here.


Come here, man. Piss off.


You're going to take a walk.


If you run off, you'll bump into King Tha.


Hello my boy...


Hey you pig, what are you doing here?


You have some nerve.


You come in here knowing very well there are police
patrolling everywhere!


My brother, our job requires bloodshed...


so that everything goes well.


Here's some money.


I need to solve a matter in Alex.


So that all these cops can disappear from the township.


Look, he brought us money.


I'm sorry, my brother.


Sorry, brother.


You know our work requires a bit of criminal acts.


We're always knocking on death's door.


I'll follow you one day.


And now for a bit of light-hearted fun,


after an otherwise heavy day...


the latest viral tik tok trend in South Africa.


Is a cat from Hammanskraal dancing...


Hey Snake.


Yeah?


You see that slut.


I want her so bad. I'd fuck her all night.


She seems too loose. She's not my type.


She's my type.


She's too forward.


I like them loose.


Why do they call you Mmini and your brother Ubsuku?


They call me Mmini because I kill during the day.


Snake...


Snake! Snake!


Oh.


Oh.


How does it feel?


Why does it seem like you're shaken by such a small thing?


Our law is...


to never leave any witnesses.


That's the way it is, my brother.


I'm not cut from the same cloth as these little kids.


A little bloodshed gets them squeamish.


They're not like us.


You see that trigger finger of yours...


now we're going to remove it.


As you wish...


Take him.


Get out of here.


The next time I see you...


you're a dead man.


Fuck, bitch!


Night slayer.


The time has come for us to stand up.


Tell that man, his time is up.


Who are you?


Huh?


Who the hell are you?


Frikkie, handle this.


Snake sends his regards you dogs! Hello!


Wait, wait.


I'm security.


Speak to me for the last time, Frikkie. Quickly, quickly!


This is the Big Boss.


You can get rid of us, but you still have to deal with them.


Let me speak to him. I'll make it square, you'll see.


Go on.


Boss.


So little done, so much to do.


Boss...


I'm sorry.


Frikkie.


Tie up the loose ends, will you?


I hear you, boss.


I'll deal with my Chinas myself.


What's your boss saying? Talk.


Come closer... Listen here...


He said make it a hell of a bloody show.


Look there...


He's watching...


Where are you running to Matthew?


Yes, Matthew!


- Where are you going, Matthew?
- No, man.


Wait a minute.


Hmm?


- Please, I've got money.
I've got lots of money, I can give you money.


Now you're begging.


I've got lots of money, lots of money,
I can give it to you.


Please.


Please! I can make it worth your while.


Please, please!


Let me help, please.


Sleep well, old man.


What happened to Mmini?


He saved my life, he's dead.


You said these people are knocking off at 22h00.


It's 23h50. What's going on here?


They said they'll be here. Just relax.


I'll get out the car first.


And once I have him distracted, you'll jump out and do what
you are a pro at doing.


Holding people up, right?


Leave it to me, my boy.


We the big dogs...


are pros at ending lives.


Is it them? What are they saying? What do they want?


- What do they want?
- Just relax.


It's on.


Thank you!


Hey, Druza.


We're sorry for leaving you in the dark.


It's all good.


- It's water under the bridge.
- Yeah.


Okay, that was Tshepiso. The money has been deposited.


All we have to do is launch it and the
50 million is Kassified.


We're going to finally save the hood, man.


This is what we...


Bullshit.


It's happening. Did you think I'd never find you?


Bra Snake, wait up.


Shut up.


- Bra, the money is there.
- Shut up!


Down, Snake.


Okay, let's launch, guys.


- What?
- What?


- It's done.
- It's done?


What?


We've launched.


Oh yes!


Say that again?


We have launched!


- You, my friend!
- Come on, man.


- I have given the township financial freedom.
- No, we have given the hood a gift.


- I'll take that.
- Yes!


- To Kasi Dolla.
- To Kasi Dolla.


Let me just go and check on...


Snake!


What the fuck?!


- Andrew!
- Druza!


Andrew, Andrew!


Andrew!


Breathe! No, no, no, no! Just breathe!


Fuck!


No! No! No!


What's going on here?


Okay, okay.


No, no.


Hey, sir.


Put these on and tighten them.


Let me see our work, please, just one more time.


Hey, murderer! Put those on.


Tighten them.


The laptop. Bring the laptop.


What brings you here?


That's none of your business.


You are my family.


Andrew.


Andrew.


Andrew.


- Andrew.
- Wake up, boy.


Andrew!


Where are the keys?


Stay.


Where is Mmini?


Mmini!


Mmini!


You killed my brother.


I'm going to shoot all of you.


Get out!


Get out!


Okay, okay!


Don't you fucking touch her you hear me!


- Don't you fucking touch her!
- Hey!


Hey! Hey!


- Move!
- Okay, okay.


Sit here! Get down over here!


Okay...


I'll start with you Mr CEO!


You killed my brother! Come here!


Come here.


Fuck off man! Just leave him!


Hey, Ubsuku!


They killed Mmini, these people.


- Stop it, man.
- Hey you!


Wait!


They don't have the money.


Stellies' launcher is also not here.


Mmini can't do anything now.


Knees, knees.


Knees. On your knees!


Down dammit!


Piss off. This is not all the money.


Where's the money? Huh?


Okay, let's play Russian Roulette.


We played it so much when I was an MK soldier.


- Let's go.
- Yes.


We'll start with you, beautiful.


Bold.


- Shoot!
- I don't want to, I don't want to!


- Leave me alone!
- Dude, Stop please, I am begging.


I'll fight you.


Shut up, bitch!


Shut up, bitch.


- We want all the money.
- Shoot.


- Shoot!
- I'll help you.


What will I shoot you for?


Shoot!


Fine, I'll shoot you.


We couldn't carry the 50 million in one bag.


I told you, you're smart.


Shoot!


Shoot!


Mr CEO, we can start with you.


- You.
- Please, sir I'm begging.


- I like you the most.
- We don't have the money!


Piss off, man!


Piss off, man!


Shoot the princess.


Shoot.


- Shoot the princess.
- I don't want to.


I don't want to.


Piss off, man.


- Shoot.
- Shoot me.


Shoot me, then.


Okay, woah.


You're lucky.


Listen, guys, please.


We don't have the money, okay?


We went public today.


We're trying to get onto the JSE, okay?


So we gave all the money to the union leaders
and to the miners.


We wanted them to buy Kasi Dolla stocks okay...


so that they could drive the stock price up.


- Bullshit!
- I'm telling you.


You lying, bastard.


Snake, these kids think we are playing.


Please.


Woah, Snake, please.


Please, we're begging you!


You'll end up in a coffin!


This is not Mother Mary.


Drop the gun, Mokwepa.


Mokwepa, drop that fucking gun or
I'll blow your head up brother.


I have you now, you fucking snake!


Fuck! Kill me, you and your falcons.


I'll die for my sins.


- My brother...
- These bastards.


Take this off me!


Hey, stay down.


Stay down.


Yeah.


Your partner also stared at me with those puppy eyes...


before I put his lights out.


Your time is up.


Bring him here.


Come through.


I told you, I'll get you.


Hey? How does that make you feel? I told you I'd kill you if
I ever laid eyes on you again.


Don't play God. He knows how to avenge himself.


God?


You know...


That's the story we were told while growing up,
something to believe in.


Because we couldn't do anything ourselves.


Now get on your knees.


I guess, my number has been called.


A person doesn't choose their life.


The life I live chose me.


You see life...


doesn't have the power to tell us how to live it.


But that power is ours,
we tell life how the good times roll.


No matter what it throws at us, we tell it.


You see if I see your father on the other side...


I'll kill him again...


just so you don't find him when your number is called.


Let's go, let's go, let's go!


Hurry.


Hurry up, hurry up!


Don't be afraid when your enemies dig your grave...


because those that are buried deep are
stretched beyond their reach.


Just like the planted seeds that grow into
great and mighty trees.


Just like little old Bonang


who became Dorothy, Doro-Slay-Bae Mabetha.


Aka the real ghetto hero King Tha.


Owner of Mabetha Holdings.


- Hey!
- Look at this thin lollipop!


Stop it!


Why would you do this to each other?


Kasi Dolla was attractive to her...


because it gave her the stronghold she needed...


to stand up to the giants of the South African economy.


Enough!


I'm Pitso hey.


I'm Bonang.


This is Kagiso.


That's Rego, that's Andrew and that's Dwayne.


Foresight, guys.


Bonang?


- Duh.
- You are Doro-Slay-Bae.


Woah, King Tha?


It's me for real!


You sent us the package?


She bought up our stock with Alexandra Taxi Drivers' pension
funds...


that she wrestled out of Jacob's hands.


My goodness.


Cappie.


Please take care of them. They took care of me.


She ensured that the factory workers,
drivers and street vendors...


Hurry up cops are coming, make it snappy.


- To Kasi Dolla.
- To Crypto.


The people first...


the people own the major shares of Kasi Dolla!


Grandma said it.


Treat people the way you would want to be treated.


The thing is...


to shift the tilt from a dire cause to righteous reactions


that guarantees long term wins without the losses...


could only be birthed


from Credo like bifocal vision. Do what you must to manifest
the future you want.


Finesse with that Solomon wisdom sauce, in how you chess
move your effect.
