

Are you all right?


This is gonna be the worst.


You know that's why
I'm missing Jessica's party?


It will be a very long ten days,
if you keep this up.


- This sucks!
- Why didn't we go to a hotel,


than normal people?


It will be all time
the most boring holiday ever!


Not for us, it won't be!


Not for us.


HOSTILE FORCES


- Here we are at last!
- What a dump!


I don't want to stay here!
I'll sleep in the car.


- Here we are.
- Yes, I think so!


As you wish.


The bush is full of wild boars.


- I meant that they were walking around.
- Yes.


Enjoy sleeping in the car.


My God!


What is that smell?


It smells like
of a dead rat.


Apparently your brother had visitors.


It seems.
The fire is still burning.


You could have cleaned up!


He didn't know we were coming.


You didn't tell him?


That's right, Sophie!


No phone, no internet.


You obviously didn't check your messages.


Unannounced,
we just came here!


This is my brother.
What's the big deal?


When he divorced, he stayed here.


Yes, I know the situation.


Look, I'm glad you're trying
to make things right with her,


but I'm still angry,
that we rushed at him like that,


and I don't like it!


I'm sorry, okay?
I should have told you!


Yes, you should have!


Actually too big
making a big deal out of this.


Really!


He is your brother.
You can deal with that when he gets here, okay?


I will!


What about sleeping in the car?


We have changed our minds.


I smell stink!


My God!


Look how young you were!
And my Uncle Noah.


Help!


What is this?


This is a 1944 penny.


This was the first money,
my grandfather gave me.


He also got it from his father.


You know what?
You can have it!


This is awesome!
Thanks, Dad!


Do you know who this is?


Your great-grandfather, Mickey.


Your father was named after him.


He was brave.


- Is he the grandfather?
- Yes.


He looks so much like Dad.


Why are there no such pictures at home?


Three generations.


We all served our country.


How old were you when you applied?


16 and a half.


I'm almost there.
I could sign up.


I was young and stupid.


- The army is still ahead of you.
- I agree.


Look, I'm just asking you


to try to enjoy it all.


This place is full of surprises.


Well, I doubt it.


Just try to be open!


Let's make a deal!


If you promise to enjoy it
this journey,


you can choose where to go next.


Can we go anywhere?


Wherever you want.


- New York?
- Yes, Times Square.


That would be sick.


Okay, deal!


But no more whining, complaining


or no deal.


- Shake hands!
- Don't you trust me?


- Shake hands!
- With your father?


Let's shake hands!


It hurts!


I saw that!


I admire how well he manipulates.


And I'm wondering,
who taught him that...


I love you too!


Good morning!


Thank you.


Noah is not back yet?


I miss it too.


It has been here for a long time.


Too long.


This was my father's allowance for which
he was brought home in a box.


In a fucking metal box.


This is how our mother was thanked.


Are the children still asleep?


Yes.


You know, I could imagine,
retiring here.


It's so peaceful here.


It really is.


Well, it would be better than all day
sitting in the garage fixing cars.


Not sure for children,
will like it,


if you tell them to come here
to retreat with us.


They will come to their senses.


Yes, there is a good chance.
There is a good chance.


No Snapchat.


That's what I love about it.


Anya!


Thank you very much!


Who taught you to shoot like that?


Your father?


My turn.


Let's see how it goes!


Haven't seen me in Call of Duty?


Move over, old man!


Old man?


Look, he doesn't know,
how to hold a gun.


Keep it tight and stable!


All right, he's gonna kick you back, all right?


Hold the gun firmly!


Watch your eyes,
keep your binoculars away!


Okay.


And you pull the trigger


slowly...


and breathe!


Our little boy!


Not bad.


- Yes.
- Not bad!


Are you OK? Are you okay?


- Yes, okay.
- Your turn!


I'm fine!


Come on! It'll be fun.


No!


- Try it!
- I don't want to!


- Come on!
- I told you I don't want to!


- Really?
- Oh, my God!


- What now?
- He doesn't like guns.


What do you know about weapons?


I don't know.


- I'd better talk to him.
- No, no, no. I'm going!


Well, Jake, it looks like,
you and I are staying.


- What happened?
- I want to go home!


I hate it here! I hate it!


This cabin stinks,


and you make me do things,
that I don't want to do!


We never force you to do anything!


Mom, you forced me
to come on this vacation,


and now Dad is making me,
to shoot a gun!


Your father doesn't make you do anything.


He was just trying to get me to have some fun.


You know, since we came here,


you just complain and sulk.


It spoils the mood for all of us.


But, just look at this place!


You can't expect me to
to really enjoy this...


You know what? I won't let you,
let you ruin this vacation!


Hey, can we just...


We will be here for ten days,
you can stay here and sulk,


or you can come and have fun with us!


Stop being so selfish!
It's not just about you.


This is a load of crap!


- Come on!
- You idiot!


Hitting it won't help!


Are you the expert?


What are you doing?


This shit does not work!


And will that make it work?


- Did you look at the panel?
- Yes.


Yes?


He's the brains in the family, right?


Yes. All right, Jake!


Try it now!


Still not working.


This nonsense will not work!


Jake, you broke...
You broke the fucking TV, man!


Hey, stop!


- What?
- Go to your room!


You're not in trouble.


Go to your room, please.


You too!


- What did I do?
- You did nothing!


- I just...
- You didn't do anything.


No problem, just
go up to your room!


Go!


Okay.


Thank you.


It is so unfair.


Mickey, what is it?


What are you doing?


It's quite heavy.


Can we do this?


We should.


And this is...


What was he involved in?


What?


What did I say?


Which part do you not understand,
to your room?


There's something under the bed!


- What is there?
- Under the bed?


What's under the bed?


- What's under the bed?
- Everything all right?


What happened?


Mickey!


We have to go!


We have to go, right now!


Now!


Leave that and let's go!


What is going on?


I'll tell you in the car.
Just go.


- Back in the house!
- Who's there?


Move, move!


Get inside!


Who was it?
Dad, what's going on?


You scare me!
What was under the bed?


- Just... just...
- What's going on?


Who are these guys?


Mickey, Mickey, what are you doing?


Sophie, the door!


I locked the door!


Why are you giving me this?
I never shot anybody!


I'm not even asking you to
to shoot somebody, okay?


But you have to protect yourself,
no matter what happens!


I'm scared!


Someone is coming!


The children?


They just fell asleep!


- What should we do?
- Follow me!


Fedezz!


Well, we're screwed.


Mickey.


Hi! What's up?


Nothing, "How are you Kane"?


- "I missed you, Kane. "
- Cut the bullshit!


Why?


Is this about Noah?


Or did you find my bags?


Look, Noah had a good thing going.


We paid well in dollars,
to use this place!


We caught him stealing from us.


And you know what they say,


"There is no honour among thieves".


- So I had to...
- Yes.


I know what you did.


You found my bags, didn't you?


Yes, you found them.


Where are you hiding it, you fuck?


Otherwise, why did he get out
in the middle of the night?


We didn't see anything.
We know nothing.


- Let us go!
- Look...


I make a one-off offer


to you and your beautiful family,


and all you have to do is,
is bring out what's mine.


And then me and Franko
will go on our merry way.


Set us free!


And, if my family is safe,


I'll tell you where the bags are.


For me, I only care about my family.


I have no other offers.


I'm not repeating myself.


Get my fucking bags out!


Come on, grab it!


Then I'll blow your fucking head off!


Now get out of here
off my fucking property.


- It's cute.
- Now!


We both know,
how it works, Mickey.


Really?
Really, Kane?


Yes.


Come on!


Come on!


I think we should go in with guns,


kill them and
get the bags!


- Call the team!
- Shit!


They are not needed,
we can take them down!


We can't risk it!


Noah's stunt is already
seemed to be an admirable one.


In three days it will be another
drop in the ocean.


If we do not deliver,
we are dead men!


Where do you think this is going?


It's Mickey!


Call the fucking team!


Yes. That's Mickey.


Okay.


You know your job!
No one comes in or out!


- They took the car!
- I know.


They should have given you the bags!


If we do that, we are dead.


Now we have to get out of here!


Are you all right?


The children would not survive outside.


Hey, hey!


That's it.


This is what I do.


We'll take care of it.


Okay. Let's do it!


ETA 30 minutes.


Okay. Let's go!


- Got it?
- Yes.


We're coming over.
Give me the bag.


Come on, move it!


Cover the front!


Come with me!


Mickey!


Come outside, let's talk about it!


We've got the place surrounded.


I have invited some more friends for you.


Let's not make this difficult
more than necessary!


I just want to,
what is mine!


Mickey!


We can all get away with it!


They are gone.


Look for the bags!


Max!


You should have watched them!


- That's what I did.
- The place is empty!


I swear to God,
Kane I was watching!


Don't tell me you did this!


- Kane.
- What is it?


The buyer.


Fuck you!


Carlos.


Yes.


I know.


Last week there was a small glitch.


I'm sorry!


I would appreciate it,
if you could give me a little more time.


One of my people
had an itchy finger.


I know it's my problem,
and we're already dealing with it.


We are on schedule.


The handover will be at the agreed time!


We will not be late.


See you then!


Nothing.


You cannot go too far.


Looks like we're going hunting.


- Watch your step!
- Okay.


Is everyone OK?


- Yes?
- Yes.


Okay.
Well done, guys.


- You'll be safe here.
- Where are you going?


I'll hide the bags!


- It won't take long.
- Okay.


- Everything OK? Light a fire!
- All right.


Hey!


Okay. I'm going to get some wood.


Good to see you, my brothers and sisters!


Thank you all for
for coming here so quickly.


What is the mission?


We have 48 hours to find
and retrieve two bags.


And it may also have to do with the weather
we'll have to deal with the weather.


So, who are we dealing with?


With my former sergeant, Mickey.


With one person?


We all came here for one man?


It has a weakness.


- What is it?
- Your family.


His wife and two children.


And, if you have the bags?


Full cleaning!


No witness.


What do you mean, Boris?


We're here because you fucked up.


Now you want us to hunt him down
this fucking Mickey?


For money?


For the money you made weeks ago,
you should have paid us.


Others also think that
this is fucking bullshit?


Yes.


I fucked that up.


Well, does anyone else have anything


what else would you like to tell us?


Anyone?


Okay, good.


All in equal shares
share of Boris.


Think of it this way,
as a pay rise!


Radios on channel 2!


You two, watch the place!


The rest of you, get going!


The only way out is where we came in.


It is safer if we stay together!


- I'll be back soon.
- I'll come with you.


No. You are the man,
while I'm away.


You look after them for me!
Can you do it?


Yes.


Good boy.


What will you do?


What I was trained to do.


Kane, you copy!


Kane!


What?


Here's something.


Phil, what have you got?


Damn, where are you?


Phil!


Phil, report your location, damn it!


Dead.


He begged me, I hope you know?


He begged even when
he had a wire around his throat.


He even shouted your name.


I have not spared the time to
to squeeze the juice out of him!


I'm coming for you and your family!


And when I'm done...


they will beg me.


Run!


Run, because we're coming!


You are still ten years old.


Hey, what's wrong?


We should be there,
to help him!


That is exactly what we will do,
what your father told us to do,


that we are staying here!


Why Dad never spoke
about the war and the army?


I don't know. It's part of his life,
that he always kept to himself.


He never talked to me about it either.


I think it's better to leave it alone.


The war changed it.


How?


War changes people.


You know, your father was very close


to your father, your grandfather and...


he died in the war.


Your father never got over it.


So why did Dad want to apply?


Because he wanted to,
to make his father proud.


Your grandfather raised your father


from a very young age,
to become a soldier.


He trained here on this land.


I think this is the real reason why
he didn't want to come back all these years.


This place is a reminder of the war.


Dad had been gone for hours.


- I hope you are well!
- I hope so too, baby!


What if he doesn't come back?


- It will come back!
- We don't know that.


Okay, guys, stop!
This is not helping.


Dad left you in my care.


This is not Call of Duty, Jake.
This is reality now.


Jake.


I'm going.


Hey!


- Give me the gun, Jake!
- I'm not giving you the gun!


I am the boss.


We are not leaving this cave!


Give me that gun back right now!


Do you think this is a game?


- Sit down!
- But you said...


Sit your ass down!


Don't touch that gun again!


- Help!
- Come here!


Drink some water!


Give it to me!


I've thought of everything.


- I was worried that you...
- No, don't...


About ten of them are coming, fully armed.


I have to go back!


Okay.


But first you need to rest!


I have to keep them out of here.


Do what you have to do!


You look after our family!


Mickey, Mickey, Mickey!


Mickey!


You there?


I know you can hear me.


Answer me!


I know you're there.


It is not too late.


Answer me!


Just give it back,
what's mine and we'll go!


Think of your family!


It must really hurt to
your brother chose us.


And that you then turned your back on him,
when he needed you most.


Why didn't you kill me in Afghanistan?


Why do you think Noah did it,
what he did?


He knew that the only
thing to prevent


to kill you if you participate in this.


Fucking lie.


And all the time
you hated him, blamed him.


He gave his life,
to save you.


But I should have killed him
both of you when I had the chance.


What happened to you?


Come on!
You know better than anyone.


We are involved in a war
that had nothing to do with us.


Do you really think we have changed anything?


Now I have found a way,
to make it profitable.


War pays, Mickey.
I want my bags!


Well, come and get them!


I trained you.
I created you.


And now, I'm going to kill you!


What else have you been keeping from me?


I will protect you.


Did you protect me?


You call that defending me?


What do you want to know, Sophie?


What do you want to know?


You want to know how he killed me
my team killed an entire family,


while my brother
held a gun to my head?


Want to know?


What the hell are you talking about?


Look at this?


So they can identify you,
if we die in the war.


No one had orders to do that,
to protect me or save me.


I should have let him kill me.


- Baby, you're scaring me.
- I should have let him kill me.


I could live with that.


You serve...


you will come home...


but in your mind it stays.


Any way I try, baby,


this is what I have in mind.


In my fucking head.


- I know it is.
- I want it to go away!


But I just can't.


I can't.


It will not go away.


- I know, baby.
- It won't go away.


I love you!


I love you!


Fucking...


What? Fucking... fucking branches.


For a fucking guy like this.
you drag me into this shit.


Fuck this shit, man!


Here I am in the middle of nowhere.


They eat you up
fucking mosquitoes, man


This is bullshit, bro!


What was that?


It's a neat trick.


So you are the dangerous one?


Te.


Not much to see, bro.


I have cousins who...


Bigger, stronger
and far more deadly than you.


And there are ten of them, bro.


Yes, damn it, Danny DeVito,
you know what we're gonna do?


You will take me there,
where the bags are!


- And if it was the father?
- Jake, don't say that!


This does not help.


My pump is gone!


My pump is gone.


- Are you sure?
- Yes.


Do you feel like having a seizure?


Okay, baby.


Okay, one second.


Jake, we have a problem.
We have to find his pipe!


Okay, sweetie. It's going to be all right.


You just need to breathe!


Remember?
Through your nose.


Jake, it's got to be here somewhere.


I don't know... I don't know.


- It's not here!
- Shh!


- Jake!
- What do I do?


What should I do?


Anya!


- Okay.
- I'll be back.


- Jake!
- I'm going to find Dad.


- Jake, no. Jake!
- I'm coming back!


Come back! Jake!


Jake!


Damn it!
Oh, fuck!


Okay, baby.
I'm not going anywhere, okay?


I'll stay here with you.


Now I want you to relax.


Just take a deep breath!
Slow down!


Here you go.


There, that's it.


We've got the girls.


That left nine of us.


Change channel every 20 seconds!


Hung, in pairs!


You two, come with me!


Let's go outside.


Help! Help!


Mom, we have to find Jake!


I know.


I'm going.


- You must stay here!
- I'll be back.


Honey, it's safer,
if you stay here.


Mom, I won't let you,
let you go out alone!


What happens when your father comes back


and there is no one here?


Stand down, soldier!


- Step back!
- Sorry, Sergeant, you can't do that.


We guard the hiding place.


I give a direct order,
to stop!


Put the gun down!


Do as I say!


What are you doing?


What are you doing?


- They are just civilians!
- Civilians?


With a warehouse that size?


Be smart, Sarge!
It's a four-way splitter!


Let's not do this, okay?
That wasn't the point.


Mickey, stop!


Traitor!


I knew you were not a team player.


Okay.


Here's what's going to happen.


If you talk...


you go down the drain with them.


Now it seems that
a three-way hand.


Noah.


Look at me!


Sorry, Sarge.


No witness.


Come on then, you old bastard!


I'll kill you on your own
with your own fucking blade, Mickey.


Drop it!


This is adorable, Mickey,


that you think you have the advantage.


I'll slit his fucking throat!


Do it if you dare!


You bitch!


- Where are the bags?
- Drop the gun!


I will not ask again!
The bags?


Mickey!


This is embarrassing.


You're not running from a girl, are you?


Who is running?


Drop it!


Turn around slowly!


You're not going to shoot a lady, are you?


No. You are not a lady!


What does it feel like when a woman holds you?


Damn it!


Did you fucking bite me?


Fucking dog.


Seven.


Smug prick.


What did I miss?


About hunting.


And who is hunting whom?


It kills us one by one.


What's the problem, Stan?


Fancy a little friendly competition?


Afraid you're the sixth?


He's just playing with us.


Listen you fuckhead!
I'll look for it and, if I find it,


I tie them up by their feet and
and skin them alive.


Will they die to the sound of their screams?


I'll do this with or without you.


Now, go!


And don't come back,
until you find them!


Jake!


Jake!


You weren't listening to me, were you?


Janelle needs her pump.


Where are the girls?


In the cave.


I just wanted to help.


I'll distract them.


When they start to follow you,
you run off in that direction,


and you go until the old
to the old barracks!


And you will wait for me there!


Now count to ten and go!


One, two..


Nine, ten.


Hey!


The bags!


I burned them.


I was hoping you'd say that.


- The bags!
- Fuck you!


- The bags!
- Okay.


Where are they?


You have...


At your mother's.


Give him my regards.


Come out, wherever you are!


I love it all!


Whether you like it or not, I'm here.


Jake.


Jake!


Jake.


Jake, please!


I don't know. I should never have been
I should never have let him go


Mum, everything will be fine.


We will find it, I promise.
We'll be fine.


- I know.
- It's so touching.


Don't be stupid!


Please don't hurt us!


Just do as I say
and everything will be fine!


This is for you!
It's my daughter's.


This way!


- Where are the bags?
- I don't know.


Let it go!


- Help!
- Drop the gun!


Drop it!


Last chance!


Help!


Okay!


Okay. Don't hurt him!


Drop it!


Hands up!


- Take me to the bags!
- I'll take you.


Let him go,
he's just a child!


"Bumbaclot!"


In Africa in his time


we become men.


I've killed younger ones.


Say goodbye!


Goodbye.


Hey! Hey!


Well done little buddy.
I'm proud of you.


- I want to go home!
- Me too!


You did well.


Now back to the house!


Siboo, Hung, are you losing?


Five. You're only five now.


Speak!


Speak!


Fucking talk!


- Take your hands off him!
- Kane, we got the package.


You will receive the packages.


In the house now! Quickly!


And Mickey?


No tricks!


I don't want to hurt your precious girls.


How are we doing on time?


I need the bags in two hours.


If you touch my daughter, I'll kill you!


This is bullshit.


Excuse me, Stan?


Stay professional!


Are you giving me orders now?


I didn't apply for this shit.


Let me let you in on a little secret.


As soon as I get my bags...


I will kill you.


Franko?


Anya!


Anya!


Mum!


No!


Where are you going? Where are you going?


- Where are you going?
- No!


Come here!


Let him go!


Please.


Please, please!


Please! Please!


You aim and shoot!


I don't want to stay here!


- I'm scared!
- You think I'm not scared?


I am afraid.


There's nothing wrong with being afraid.


You're human, aren't you?


But for your mother and your sister
they need me, okay?


So you stay here and wait!


Wait, okay?


Look at this!


How about a threesome?


Get off me!


Come here!


Mickey.


Come here, sit down.


Sit down!


Where are they?


Safe and sound.


Get the bags out,
on the count of three.


- One, two...
- Okay!


If you do this...


you can say goodbye to your bags.


You're bluffing.


- Try it!
- Daddy, no, please!


I'll blow his fucking brains out!


If they die, I die.


You won't knock yourself out.


So what is the solution?


They walk away and you get the bags.


Everyone gets what they want.


I let one of them go
and you can choose.


Do it!


No, fuck you!


- They both walk away.
- Choose!


- Do it!
- Well?


Mickey, do it, do it!


- Who will it be?
- I'm fine!


- Mickey?
- My wife.


No, Mickey!


- No thanks.
- No, no, no...


No, no, no... I'm staying!


I will stay! I will stay!


- I stay. I will stay!
- Get up!


- I'm not going!
- Get up!


- Let go of my daughter!
- No, go away!


- Read more!
- Mickey!


- Tell him!
- Hey, hey!


Tell him I'm not leaving!


Hey, you...


- Tell him!
- Listen to me!


Listen to me!


Jake is by the creek.


At our old tribal site.


The kid needs you, okay?


You are the only one,
who knows where it is.


- Not me.
- The child needs you!


- I can't leave you here!
- Hey!


Our baby needs you, okay?
You go get our son back, you hear me?


Now go fuck yourself
don't turn back!


Don't come back!
Don't come back!


Go, go, go!


Put down your weapon!


Le!


Good dog. Turn around!


Don't do it!


Don't worry, my dear.


Your old man, a tough old bastard.


I am curious
if you can save me, Mickey.


- Get off me!
- Back inside


Sit down!


How far?


I said, "How far?"


- Close it!
- Be good!


Move it!


Where are Janelle and Daddy?


Anya?


We have to go!


Where are they?


There.


Franko, answer!


What the hell is taking so long?


Already on the spot.


You know what to do.


I should have killed you
you in Afghanistan.


Here's your fucking bag.


I'll be honest with you now,
I'm a little disappointed.


Because I was expecting some kind of struggle.


I see...


How you fight for your family's survival...


and this is the best I can offer.


This is sad.


Anyway, after that...


I will hunt your wife.


And I'm going to do that by
by hunting down your children.


I will hunt your whole family.


Hunt this down!


You are really pretty!


Look, I'm sorry about what happened.


I got a bit carried away.


Shall we try again?


I will be gentle.


Are you still a virgin?


Why don't you show me?


You are so brave.


This will be our little secret.


Yes, show me!


Just... just a little bit.


Yes, come to me!


Yes, let me touch you!


I want to taste you!


Just a little bit, yes.


My God!


Yes, yes, yes.


Is that what you meant?


Fuck you!


Kane!


- Let him go!
- This is weird.


I feel as if I had previously
we've been here before.


Let him go!


Change in the plan.


I take what I have
what is most important to you.


You are no different,
but a weak sack of shit!


Weak?
I am not weak.


- I survived, Mick.
- Really?


- Show me!
- I'll pass.


Shoot him, Mick!


I'll kill you!


I'll snap his neck like a twig.


Put the gun down!


Drop it!


Now!


Good boy.


Come here!


It's not that hard, is it?


Where are you going, Mick?


Please, Mickey, come here!


Now look at me!


Look into my eyes!


I want to be the last thing,
you see.


I told you how it would end.


Say hello to your brother for me!


This is for Noah.


Let's get out of here!


I'm sorry about Uncle Noah, Dad.


It's okay, baby.


Let's go!


Jump in, kids!


So, what happens now?


Report and drop off the bag.


- A bag?
- Yes, the bag.


I promised the children,
that they could go to New York.


Kane, it's Carlos.


Here I am!
Where's my fucking stuff?
