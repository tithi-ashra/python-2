- [Narrator] Space,
the infinite loop.


These are the first adventures
of the Starship Fairy Dust.


It's on a five-minute
mission to quickly explore


the super weird universe,


to make sure
everything's in order,


to try and usually fail
to stay out of trouble,


and to boldly get
home before bedtime.


- [Snow White]
Captain's travel log,


star date 62-37-27, hike.


It's been at least two
and one half minutes


since we left our base.


Everything seems quiet.


A little too quiet.


However, it seems as if
things are about to go


from okay to bad.


Very bad.


- Captain Snow White, we are
getting really strange readings


and reports coming in from
all over the universe.


- Strange readings and reports?


That sounds right up our alley.


What's cookin'?


- It sounds like
Blunderboar the Giant


and is naughty hound
Jack are on a rampage!


- What kind of a rampage?


Like a bad one?


- Is there such a thing as
a good rampage? (laughing)


- Don't gimme no lip, Arthur.


I'm the captain of this ship.


Now do as I say!


Just gimme the facts.


- Apparently Cupid
has just called in


to Fairytale Fun Force HQ,


saying that Blunderboar
has stolen his magic bow!


- What in the galaxy
would Blunderboar


need with Cupid's magic bow?


I mean, it's like way
too small for him.


- Maybe Blunderboar
needs the bow


to tap into its magic.


- That makes sense.


But why?


- I don't know, but it sounds
like this is gonna turn into


more than our usual
five-minute mission.


- We will capture Blunderboar
and he will say hello


to my little crown.


- Your crown is even littler
to Blunderboar. (laughing)


- That's right.


And he will respect my
authority as captain


of the Starship Fairy Dust.


Besides, I throw a
super mean drop kick.


- Whoa, we're getting some
more strange readings,


Captain Snow.


- What else?


- Robin Hood, are
you seeing this?


- Yes.


According to my dials,
there's some weird shenanigans


happening in Wonderland.


- Wonderland? Oh no!


I hope my cousin Alice is okay.


- Arthur, do you have a
reading on what's happening


in Wonderland?


- Let me check my scanners.


Peculiar.


- What's peculiar?


- There's not one, but
two separate disturbances


in Wonderland!


- Mirrors and apples!


- I-I'm getting
the same reading,


but those readings
didn't register


until Cupid's bow went missing.


- I'd recommend that where
we start our investigation,


so that-
(phone ringing)


- It sounds like we
have a call coming in.


- Put it on speaker, Robin.


- This is the
Starship Fairy Dust.


Robin Hood speaking.
How can we help you?


- [Alice] Hey, y'all!


We need some help down
here in Wonderland.


- Are you okay, cous?


- Hush, Hood. I ask the
questions around here.


- Yes, Captain.


- Are you okay, Alice?


- [Alice] I'm fine, but like
things are going haywire!


- What's happenin', Alice?


- Hey, I said I
ask the questions!


Ahem.


What's happenin', Alice?


- Hatter's gone mad!


Someone took his tea set.


And from what I understand,


Cheshire's body has
gone missing, too.


- Hasn't Cheshire's body
always been missing?


- Shh! Ahem!


Hasn't Cheshire's body
always been missing?


- Good question.


- That's why I'm the captain.


- [Alice] I have no idea.


Either way, we
really need the help


of the Fairytale Fun Force.


- On our way, Alice.


First we have to make
a couple of stops


in order to best assist you.


Hold on to one Hatter's hats.


We'll be there as
soon as possible.


- [Alice] Thanks!


- Red Riding Hood.


- Full speed ahead.


Engines set to warp.


Fairytale Fun Force, go!


- [Narrator] Before
heading out to Wonderland,


Captain Snow decided
that this investigation


should start at the beginning
of these wacky events.


Snow White and the
Fairytale Fun Force


hightail it to the Love Galaxy,


home to the one and
only Cupid the Cherub.


The Starship Fairy Dust
touches down at Cupid's home,


the Love Planet.


And Captain Snow White
heads out to find


the galaxy's most
famous pantsless wonder.


- This like totally stinks!


- Hey, Cupid!


- Captain Snow White.


Thank the cherubs you're here.


I like totally have a diorama.


- Do you mean a dilemma?


- Yeah, I think I have one
of them too and whatnot.


- Tell me what happened.


- So like you know, I got
up to play some video games,


and I was like man, dude,
I'm like hungry and whatnot.


I headed to the kitchen
and started lining up


pizza rolls on my cookie
sheet to put in the oven,


and like, uh-


- Can you skip ahead to
when the problem started?


- Oh, like yeah. For sure.


Sorry. Sometimes I get
like super distracted


by the thought of tasty,
hot pizza rolls, uh,


the way the cheese
gets all stretchy and-


- Cupid!


- Sorry.


So yeah, when I was done eating
my tasty, hot pizza rolls,


I looked up in my mantle and
noticed my magic bow was gone.


- Are you sure that you
didn't just misplace it?


- Dude, I'm a cherub.


We may have misplaced our
desires to wear pants again,


but when it comes
to our magic bows,


we know where that thing is.


But here's the weirdest thing.


- Mirrors and apples,
it gets weirder?


- Totally.


Every cherub has the BowJack
tracking system on our bows.


I should've been able
to track where it was


by checking on my fPhone
in the Find My app.


But there's no signal.


It's like the bow ever existed.


- How do you know that
it was Blunderboar


who stole the bow?


- 'Cause there were
giant-sized footprints


in front of my mantle.


Nobody in the galaxy
has stompers that big.


Not even Little Foot.


- Noted.


Okay, I have one more question.


Who makes these magical items
like your bow, et cetera?


- Santa's elves, of course.


They make everything
that has a magic base.


They're the ones who installed
the BowJack system, too.


- Okay, then that's my
next stop. The North Pole.


Sit tight, Cupid.


And since your pantsless, try
not to sit on a white couch.


- Roger, Captain
Snow. And thanks!


- Snow White to
Starship Fairy Dust.


Come in, Fairy Dust.


- [Robin Hood] Yes, Captain.


- Zap me back, Robin Hood,
and set our travel dials


to the North Pole.


- [Narrator] Robin Hood
sets a course to visit Santa


on the North Pole planet.


As quick as a flash
the Starship Fairy Dust


continues its latest
mysterious adventure.


As the Fairy Dust touches
down at the North Pole,


Captain Snow White finds
the one and only Mr. C.


comfy and cozy
inside of his house.


(chimes ringing)


- Ho-ho! Howdy, Snow.


- Santa! Good to see ya.


I wish I was here for funsies,


but I am once again on
serious and official


Fairytale Fun Force business.


- Oh?


Is there another disturbance
in the Fun Force?


- Yeah, there's something
super strange brewing.


- Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!


Oh, you mean like
carbonated eggnog?


Well, spoiler alert.


It's pretty gross.


What's the trouble and
how can I, ho-ho-ho, help?


- There's all sorts of
goofy stuff happening.


The Hatter is
missing his tea set,


and apparently Cheshire's
body is missing.


- Cheshire had a body?


- I know, right?


Anyway, this all started
once Cupid's magic bow


went missing, and not
even BowJack is working


for us to track it.


There's gotta be some form
of trace magic left behind


from it somewhere, right?


- Mmm, let me check
in with my elves.


Stay here while I
ask my best helper,


Bellyflop the Penguin.


- Okey dokey.


(chimes ringing)


- Santa! Santa!


I was just coming to see you.


Something screwy is going on.


- I know all about it
already, Bellyflop.


- You know about the missing
tea set and Cheshire's body?


- Yes, though I have to say


Cheshire having a body


is the biggest surprise of all.


This all started when Cupid's
magic bow went missing.


- That shouldn't be a
problem. It was BowJack.


- Yes, but according to Cupid,


BowJack isn't working.


Is there another way
the bow can be traced?


- Let me go speak
with the elves.


I'll call you as soon
as I know anything.


- Oh, thanks, Bellyflop.


(chimes ringing)


- What's the verdict, Mr C.?


- I have the elves looking
into everything for you.


If Cupid's bow can
be traced at all,


they'll find a way to do it.


- That's great
news! Thanks, Santa!


- Oh, you are very
welcome, Snow.


- I'm actually a little
worried about this


because this is a
lot of strange stuff


to be happening in such
a short span of time.


- Do you not have
any other leads?


- Well, Cupid says that
Blunderboar is the one


who took the magic bow.


He says there were
giant-sized footprints


in front of the mantle
where he kept his bow.


- What in the world
could Blunderboar


want with Cupid's magic bow?


And what could this
possibly have to do


with what's going
on in Wonderland?


- I haven't any idea.
It's all so goofy.


- What do a magical bow,


a sentient cat head's body,


and a tea set have in common?


Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!


- Could they be the ingredients
of some form of magic spell?


- Oh you know, mmm, I bet
you're onto something.


Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!


- Thanks, Mr. C. (laughing)


That's why I'm the captain.


- If you can fix this,


I promise you'll be very high


on my nice list.


- Don't worry
Santa, we got this.


The Fairytale Fun Force
are on the case! (laughing)


- Well, good luck to you.


Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!


- Thanks for the
assistance, Santa.


- No worries, Snow.


Let me know if there's anything
else that I can do to help.


- Right-o.


Snow to Fairy Dust.
Zap me back, Robin.


(chimes ringing)


- I bet you one of the
transporters would make


my yearly rounds
go a lot quicker.


Hmm.


(chimes ringing)


- Okay crew, listen up.


Santa and his elves are trying
to see if Cupid's magic bow


can be tracked somehow.


However, we still have a
Wonderland-size problem.


- What's that, Captain?


- The Wonderland
calamity may or may not


be tied to Cupid's
missing magic bow.


Arthur, you've spent a lot
of time down on Wonderland.


I think you should
speed on down there


and see what you could dig up.


- Great Merlin's beard!


Another adventure in Wonderland!


Tally ho!


- In the meantime, the
crew and I will stay aboard


and wait for either your
return or Santa's phone call,


whichever comes first.


- Sounds like a plan.


- Can we order a
pizza, Captain Snow?


I was listening in on the
conversation with Cupid


and eh, it got me hungry.


- Please save a slice for me,


your resident knight
of the round table.


- I can make no promises.


I usually save all the
extra slices for Grandma.


- I'll make sure you get
one, Arthur. No worries.


- Buy the power of my
faithful Excalibur!


Let's do this.


- [Narrator] Captain
Snow White stays aboard


the Starship Fairy Dust while
Science Officer King Arthur


goes out to investigate
the missing body


of one of the most colorful
characters in all of Wonderland.


The infamous Cheshire Cat.


- Hello?


Anybody out here?


Cheshire!


I need to speak with you.


Cheshire?


Yoo-hoo!


- Arthur, you here again?


You should just
move to Wonderland.


- Hello, old friend.


This is no mere social call.


I am here on official
Fairytale Fun Force business.


- I thought your Fairytale
Fun Force missions


only lasted five
minutes per journey.


- That's only when
things are okay,


and right now they are
clearly not all right.


- Oh, what's cooking?


- Well, firstly we've
received reports


that your body has gone missing.


- Um, Arthur, my body has been
missing since I was a kitten.


This is so nothing new.


- Maybe so, but now
it's missing missing.


- You mean like gone gone?


- Aren't missing missing


and gone gone the same thing?


- I have no idea. (chuckling)


However, I can tell you where
I think that my body was last.


If you wanna know that,


you're once again gonna have
to pay the informations.


- Doesn't that mean
I'm gonna have to


catch you or something?


- That's correct.


- I knew I should've brought
that butterfly catching net!


Hey! Where'd ya go?


- I'm right here.


- Where?


- Here!


- Cheshire, I really don't
have time for this right now!


Things are getting crazy
here in Wonderland.


Cupid's magic bow is missing,


and who knows what
kind of trouble Hatter


is gonna get himself
into without his tea set.


- Whoa!


Did you just say that
Hatter's tea set was missing?


Oh, now that is
serious business.


I'm not sure if knowing that
location of where I think


my body was last will
be enough to help.


- Well, it couldn't hurt either.


- Oh, okay. I'm gonna try
something I rarely do.


- Uh-oh. Should I stand
back or something?


- No, it's not
dangerous or anything.


Sometimes if I
concentrate really hard


I can almost feel
where my body is.


I just need to concentrate
and do some chanting.


- Chanting?


- Shhh.


Where you is or where
you went, my body.


Body, body, won't
you tell me now?


Body do zay zot zet tee.


Body do zay zot zet tee.


Body do zay zot zet tee.


Body do zay zot zet tee.


Body do zay zot zet tee.


Body do zay zot zet tee.


Body do zay zot zet tee.


Body do zay zot zet tee.


- That's kinda catchy.


- Shh. I'm getting something.


- Can I chant with you?


- Sure.


- [Both] Body do
zay zot zet tee.


Body do zay zot zet tee.


Body do zay zot zet tee.


Body do zay zot zet tee.


Body do zay zot zet tee.


Body do zay zot zet tee.


Body do zay zot zet tee.


- I've got it!


I feel it! I know it!


- Great Merlin's beard!


I feel it, too!


- You feel my body?


Can you scratch my belly?


I'd really like a good,
old-fashioned belly scratch.


- Later!


Where was your body last?


- Easterland!


- Are you sure?


- I would state my reputation
as an inter-dimensional,


hyper-dimensional
kitty cat on it!


- Amazing!


- Yes, yes I am.


- You've been a
huge help, Cheshire.


Do you want me to bring
your body back to you?


- No way.


- Why not?


- I haven't had to use
a litter box in years.


I have no desire to
start now. (laughing)


- (laughing) Okay, gotcha.


- See ya around, Sir Kingy.


I got places to go
and people to spook!


- Arthur to Fairy Dust!


- [Red Riding Hood]
Fairy Dust here.


What can I do for you, KA?


- Zap me back onto the ship.


I have another lead!


Roses are red and so is my cape.


We can do this, make no mistake!


(transporter zapping)


- [Snow White]
Captain's trave log,


star date 72-27-06, hike!


Science Officer King Arthur
has returned to the ship


with news about the whereabouts
of Cheshire cat's body.


Will this lead to another clue?


- According to Cheshire,
his body was last seen


frolicking about in Easterland.


- Cheshire frolics?


- I know.


Once you realize that,
it sort burns its way


into your memory,
doesn't it? (laughing)


- No joke.


I can picture him scampering
and prancing, too.


Like egh!


- Too much information!


- Before we go to Easterland,


shouldn't we check
in on the Hatter?


- I think it would be
more productive to follow


one lead at a time.


We can always come back here.


Besides, the Hatter
can be a bit of a,


what's the right word?


Chore? (laughing)


- you can say that
again. (laughing)


So Easterland it is.


Do you want me to take
point again, Arthur?


- If it's all the same with you,


I'd rather stay aboard
the ship and eat my pizza.


My tummy is growling and
the inside of this ship


smells extra yummy.


You did save me a slice, right?


- Yep.


Y'all find it in your quarters
on your favorite round table.


- Hizah, I say!


Mega hizah!


- Okay, so we need a
volunteer to head down


to Easterland to do
some investing thing.


Any volunteers?


- I'll go. I dig Easterland.


I relate to the wicker
Easter baskets in that area.


They tell me things since
I'm wooden and stuff.


- Mirrors and apples!


Pinocchio, you're officially
running point on this one.


- Good. I'll just tell a
few lies and follow my nose.


- [Narrator] The action
continues on the home world


of all that is Easter.


The world's most famous
little wooden toy, Pinocchio,


heads out into the
wilds of Easterland


to see if he can nail down
when was the last time


anyone has seen the
Cheshire Cat's body.


- Man! What a beautiful day!


But why do I feel like there's
something weird going on?


Oh, maybe it's
just me. Who knows.


(chimes ringing)


- Ciao. I'm little
Pinocchio, the wooden toy.


- I know who you are, silly.


- What can I say? That's
my favorite greeting.


- Whatcha doing all
your way out here


in Easterland,
Pinocchio? (laughing)


- There's some really weird
things going on, Bert.


- I knew it. I could
feel it in the air.


- Yep. My nose is
long and never wrong.


- Hey, that's sort
of like my ears.


I use them like antenna.


You know, to pick
up vibes and stuff.


- Is that why rabbits
have long ears?


I thought they were
like, you know,


handles to make it
easier for magicians


to pull you out of hats.


- Very funny.


You really wanna know why
rabbits have long ears?


- Yeah, I love learning
new stuff, so sure.


- One of the main things
that long rabbit ears do


is to help bunnies maintain
their correct body temperature.


- How?


- Ooh, bunny ears
usually have thinner fur


along with a network
of small blood vessels.


- Uh-oh, are things
gonna get sciencey?


I'm-I'm not good
with sciencey stuff.


- Not too sciencey. (laughing)


The thin fur and blood
vessels allow bunnies


able to easily
tell how much heat.


- Wait, are you telling me
that bunnies have long ears


to make sure they can
be comfy and cozy?


- (laughing) Eh, sorta. Yeah.


The blood vessels
inflate like a balloon


on hot days to give off heat,


and then they shrink on
cold days to maintain


their body temperatures.


- Whoa!


And here I was thinking
that the long ears


were just so that you fuzzy
folks could hear better.


- Oh, they work for that, too.


Bunny ears are also designed
for excellent hearing.


- So do bunnies have
better hearing than humans?


- Mmm, kind of.


You see, when it comes
to low vibration counts,


a bunny's hearing ability is
about the same as a human,


but when it comes to
high vibration counts,


bunnies can hear those
from up to two miles away.


- You have like super ears!


- For the most part,
but only because those


high vibration counts,
also known as frequencies,


would be totally quiet
to the human ear.


- What about my
ears? They're wooden.


Can you hear better than me?


- Um. (gurgling)


- Holy nostrils, Bert.
I'm just kidding.


- Phew!


I wasn't really sure how
to answer that. (laughing)


So tell me, what's going on?


- Ah, man.


It's more like what
isn't going on.


First, Cupid's magic
bow went missing.


Then, Cheshire's
body disappeared.


- Cheshire had a body? Really?


- Yuppers, and
believe it or not,


that's exactly why I'm here.


According to Mr. Floating
Inter-dimensional,


Hyper-dimensional
Kitty Cat Head,


his body was last seen
here in Easterland.


- I haven't seen it.


I think I'd remember
a headless kitty body


tooling around
the Easter Garden.


- Wow, what a sight
that would be.


- Hmm, you know who
you may wanna talk to?


- Who?


My right paw, MVP,
Goldie the Golden Goose.


- Do you think
Goldie would know?


- She knows
everything. (laughing)


Way more than I do.


If it's happening
somewhere on this planet,


Goldie is aware of it.


- That's a great
idea. Where is she?


- She's over in the Egg Forest.


Just phase on over.


Tell her I sent ya.


- Thanks, Bert.
- No worries.


And good luck, amigo.


(chimes ringing)


- Hey, hey, Goldie girl.


- Why, Pinocchio!


What brings you all the way
out here to the Egg Forest?


- I have a question for you.


- You do? How exciting.


Tell me, what do you wanna know?


- By any chance have you
seen the headless body


of the Cheshire Cat around here?


- Holy moly! How did you know?


Are you a psychic or something?


- No, but I guess
you have seen it?


- I sure have.


- Holy nostrils!


Please, tell me what happened.


- So Cheshire's body finds
its way here sometimes


because it can't see
where it's going.


- Why does it come here?


- Because it sometimes
mistakes are Easter baskets


as litter boxes.


- Um. Ew?


- You're telling
me. Ew. (laughing)


Anyway, it started
happening so often


that we started leaving specific
baskets in specific places.


Cats are creatures
of habit, you know?


- Oh, those poor
defenseless wicker baskets,


just sitting there,
waiting to be pooped in.


It breaks my heart.


- You can communicate
with wicker?


- Yes ma'am.


I am made out of wood, you know?


- Hmm.


Good point.


- Anyway.
- Anyway. (chuckling)


Cheshire's body was
here scratching around


that basket over there.


I turned my back
for just a second.


Then I heard this
strange whooshing sound.


I turned around and
his body was gone.


Vanished into thin air.


- Hmm. (sniffing)


I smell something funny.


- You do? (sniffing)


Hmm.


I don't.


- That's because you're not
in tune with the wicker.


I am.


And that basket
you're talking about


that Cheshire's body was in
has a very distinct smell.


- It doesn't.


What does it smell like?


- Tea.
- Tea?


You mean like the drink tea?


- Yep. Bingo.


That's very interesting.


- How come?


- Because the Hatter's
tea set is missing, too.


- So three things are missing?


- Yep. Cupid's bow,
the Hatter's tea set,


and Cheshire's body.


- What in the world do those
three things have in common?


- I'm thinking
Blunderboar the Giant,


who we know took Cupid's bow,


is using them as some
sort of magic spell.


We just don't know why.


- What are you gonna do next?


- To be honest, I'm not sure.


- I wish I could have
been more helpful.


- Are you kidding?
You've been great.


I'm gonna head back to
the Starship Fairy Dust,


report in to Captain Snow
White, and have her decide.


- Now that sounds
like a good idea.


- Thanks, Goldie.


- Anytime, Pinocchio. Good luck.


- [Snow White]
Captain's travel log,


star date 78-69-14, hike!


Pinocchio has returned
to the ship to share


what he's learned.


It's not much, but at least
it sounds as if the dots


are slowly being connected.


- So the litter basket on
Easterland smelled like tea?


- Maybe Cheshire's
body was drinking tea


and had to go potty.


- The body doesn't
even have a head.


How could it go potty?


- Nature will find
a way! (chuckling)


Seriously though, being that
the basket smelled like tea,


I'm nearly positive
this has something to do


with Hatter's missing tea set.


- And that, Pinocchio, is
why you're my first mate.


- Aye, aye, Captain.


What's our next move?


- Well, we have been to
Cupid's and tracked down


the last seen whereabouts
of Cheshire's body.


That leaves one more
place to investigate.


- We're heading
back to Wonderland?


- Hush.


I am the captain.


Ahem.


We're heading back
to Wonderland.


- Um, good idea?


- That's why I'm the captain.


Robin, set a course
for Wonderland.


It's time to talk with Hatter.


- Fairy Tale Fun
Force to the rescue.


(warp speed warbling)


- [Narrator] And
quick as a flash,


the Fairy Tale Fun
Force speeds back


to the Wonderland galaxy
to interview one of


the craziest characters
in the entire universe.


The Hatter.


Some say that the Hatter's tea
set is one of the only things


to keep him
connected to reality.


Will he be even
crazier without it?


Let's find out.


- Hey!


Yoo-hoo!


Captain Snow White here.


Official Fairytale
Fun Force business.


Hello?


Where is everyone?


(chimes ringing)


- Humans have been performing
dentistry since 7,000 BC,


which makes dentists one
of the oldest professions.


- Um.


Huh?


- Apples, peaches and
raspberries are all members


of the rose family.


- Hatter, are you okay?


- Oh, thank heavens
help is here.


Yeah, he's been
like this all day.


- Canada eats more
macaroni and cheese


than any other
nation in the world.


- Been like what?
What's he talking about?


- Ever since his tea set went
missing, he's short-circuited.


He's just been running round
spoutin' strange facts.


- Are the facts, though?


- An animal's yawn is based
on how large their brain is.


The bigger the brain, the
longer they will yawn.


- I mean, I think that they are.


- Dinosaurs would swallow
large rocks which stayed


in their stomach to help
churn and digest food.


- So weird.


Anyway, I'm glad to
see that you're still


of this world, Dormouse.


- I am, but I have no
idea how much longer


I can put up with Hatter's
barrage of strange factoids!


- Surgeons who play video
games at least three hours


a week performed 27% faster


and make 37% fewer errors.


- What can you tell
me about the time


when the tea set went missing?


- Well, everyone was
just sitting down to tea.


Even the white
rabbit was on time.


Had to turn around
to get some biscuits,


and we heard this
strange whooshing sound.


- A strawberry is
not an actual berry,


but a banana is.


- What kind of a
whooshing sound?


- Like an arrow flying
through the air.


- In Israel it is illegal
to bring bears to the beach.


- Apples and mirrors!
That makes sense!


- What does?


That it's against the law
to bring bears to the beach?


- Well yeah, but that's not
what I meant. (laughing)


You see, Blunderboar the
Giant stole Cupid's magic bow.


Maybe that bow was used
to shoot Hatter's tea set


so it could be hijacked.


Then the Cheshire Cat's
body disappeared over


in Easterland, leaving
behind the smell of tea.


- Okay, so the award for the
most absurd heist goes to.


(Dormouse laughing)


- It snowed in the Sahara
Desert for 30 minutes


on February 18, 1979.


- This is proof positive
that all of these things


are somehow related and
not isolated incidents.


- Related and completely weird.


- March 3rd is known as
What If Cats and Dogs


Had Opposable Thumbs Day?


- Snow, you have to
find Hatter's tea set.


I don't know how
much more of this


my fuzzy little head can handle.


- A snail can sleep
for three years.


- Don't worry, Dormouse.


The Fairytale Fun
Force is on it.


- The fear of vegetables
is called lachanophobia.


(chimes ringing)


There is an island
called Just Enough Room,


where there's just enough
room for a tree and a house.


- I knew I should
have bought those


noise-canceling headphones.


- [Hatter] "She Sells Sea
Shells By the Seashore"


was written about a female
paleontologist from the 1800s.


She actually sold dinosaur
bones and fossilized shells.


- Captain's travel log,
star date 99-98-97, hike!


As expected, all three of
these mysterious disturbances


seem to connect in
some mysterious way.


The most leaves ever found


on a clover is 56.


Ugh, now Hatter has me doing it!


And so, yes, I, captain
of this starship


and your fearless leader
have determined that yes,


all three of these strange
incidents are related.


- But how?


- Which one of you suggested
that maybe these three objects


are the ingredients for
some kind of magic spell?


- That would be you, Captain!


- Oh.


Well yeah, of course it was me.


That's why I'm the captain.


Maybe we should go and visit
Geppetto the Toy Maker.


He brought Pinocchio to life.


Maybe he knows more than a few
things about magical spells.


- Hush, I'm trying to think.


Oh, mirror, mirror,
what do we do?


Wait, I've got it.


Maybe we should go and visit
Geppetto the Toy Maker.


He brought Pinocchio to life.


Maybe he knows more than a few
things about magical spells.


- Great idea.


- Don't worry, King Arthur.


One day you'll be as
quick thinking as I am.


- I can't wait!


- Okay, so we need a volunteer
to head down to Toyland


to do the investigating thing.


Any volunteers?


- Not me.


Every time I go and visit Pop,
he thinks I want something.


- Don't you usually
want something?


- Well yeah, but
that's not the point.


- Okay, I'll go again.


The mystery of the magic
Easter egg continues


in every boy and girl's favorite
place, the Land of Toys.


(chimes ringing)


I'm the beautiful Snow White.


Nice to meet you.


- Hello, my little bambina.


I know who you are.


- You do?


(Geppetto laughing)


- You're the Capitan Snow White
of the Starship Fairy Dust.


You're my bambino
Pinocchio's, eh, how you say?


Eh, the boss.


- (laughing) That's right.


- Tell me, how's
my bambino doing?


He give you the trouble?


- Nope. No trouble at all.


He's my first mate,
my right hand toy.


- A-really?


That-a make me the happy.


Tell Geppetto, what-a
can I do for you?


- I'm here on official
Fairytale Fun Force business.


There's wacky things happening.


- I know.


I can, uh, how you say,
sense such a-things.


- Really?


- I know that there's
a-three things wrong.


I just don't know what they are.


- How do you know that
there's three things wrong?


- These are things, they
always come in threes.


Now, parla me.


- Salami?


- Ha ha! You crazy in the head.


No salami. Parla me.


That's Italiano for
a-talk to me, eh?


- Oh, okay.


So Blunderboar the Giant
stole Cupid's magic bow.


- You mean the little
fella without-a the pants?


- Yeah, him.


After his bow went missing,


other things started
disappearing,


like the Hatter's tea set,


and then the
Cheshire Cat's body.


- Mama mia! The Cheshire Cat?


He had-a the body?


- That's what everyone
says! (laughing)


- Hmm.


That sound-a like the
Blunderboar is a-makin'


the magic spell.


- Yeah, but what kind of spell?


- Let me see.


Magic bow, the tea set,


and the Cheshire Cat's corpo.


Hmm.


- (laughing) Corpo?


I'm guessing that's
Italiano for body?


- Si! I think that I have it.


- You know what
Blunderboar is doing?


- Si.


I think he's a-making
the prison a-spell.


- The prison spell?


- Si.


He was to keep
a-somebody locked up.


He need-a the bow to soak
the magic arrow in the tea.


And then he needed
the cat corpo to make


the arrow shoot even faster.


- So, the arrow dipped in
tea wouldn't be quick enough


to shoot whomever
Blunderboar wants to lock up


into their prison? (laughing)


- Si.


The magic arrow would've
needed to be, uh,


how you say, quicker
than the cat.


That's a-why he needed
the tea and the cat corpo.


- (laughing) But who
would Blunderboar want


locked up and why?


- Hey, oh-ho-ho!


One a-mystery at a time,
bambina de capitan. (laughing)


- (giggling) Maybe all that
would be enough information


for Santa to tell his elves
so that they can track down


the whereabouts of Cupid's bow.


- Si.


The bow lead a-you
to the tea set.


The tea set a-lead
you to the cat corpo,


and all three will
a-lead you to the person


that Blunderboar wants
to lock away. (laughing)


- Thanks, Geppetto.
You've been a huge help!


- Oh, you are welcome.


Anytime, bambina de capitan.


- Sweet.


Hey, before I go I have
one other question.


- Ah, go on. (laughing)


- Can you make us some pizza?


I know we already ate,


but you can never have
too much pizza. (laughing)


- Of a-course.


Gotta make a-sure
my boy, he eats.


The last time I seen
a-him, he was as thin


as a matchstick. (laughing)


- You really are
the best, Geppetto.


I love ya!


- Aw, thank you, Snow.


I love a-you, too.


Tell a-my son and
the crew I say hello.


- [Snow White]
Captain's travel log,


star date 44-70-88, hike.


I brought back a large
pie from the Land of Toys


and I'm hoping that
everyone will be thinking


super clear on an
extra full tummy.


A new mystery has
presented itself,


and before we tackle that,


we need to transmit our
info to Santa Claus.


- Great Merlin's beard,
that was tasty pizza.


- Tell me about it.


Did you send that email to
Santa about the missing items


being needed for an
imprisonment spell?


- I sure did.


- Did you clean off the
keyboard when you were finished?


I hate when there's tomato
sauce on the keyboard.


- Why, of course I did.


Making mental note to clean
off the keyboard ASAP.


- What?
- Nothing.


Was just singing a song
at the round table.


You know, tally-ho
and all that jazz.


- Oh, incoming call from
the North Pole, Captain!


It's Santa!


- What?


It is? Put him on speaker.


Hi, Santa. Did you
get our message?


- [Santa] I did, and I don't
think that you're going


to like this next
part of your journey.


- Why? Is it dangerous?


- [Santa] Only to
your mental state.


Well, I'm afraid you're
going to have to take


a trip to Sherwood Forest
to talk to Mr. Fox.


- I'm so angry! (screaming)


- New!


- Ugh.


- My, what great,
big problems we have.


- Once again, new!


- Great Marlin's beard!


Anything but that.


- [Santa] I'm sorry, children.


Apparently Blunderboar
was last seen


talking to Mr. Fox
in Sherwood Forest.


No one knows where that
mean old giant is right now


because my elves are still
trying to trace the magic bow.


But I'm thinking that Old
Foxy may have something


to do with this whole mess.


- Roger that, Mr. C.


Please let us know if you
get a hit on the BowJack.


- [Santa] Will do. Good luck.


- Red Riding Hood, set travel
dials to Sherwood Forest.


- Roses are red
and so is my cape.


We can do this, make no mistake.


- Okay, guys gotta
go. I'll see you.


- Don't you dare.


Sherwood is your place and you
know it better than anyone.


That means this part of the
mission is up to you, Robin.


- Great.


Time with Mr. Fox talking
about himself, ugh.


Fairytale Fun Force, go.


- Come on. You can be more
enthusiastic than that.


Put some spunk into it!


- Fairytale Fun Force, go.


- [Narrator] The Starship
Fairy Dust is ready to float


its way toward the
Sherwood Forest,


which lies in the
center of Magic Kingdom.


That's where everyone's favorite
chatterbox Mr. Fox lives.


Will Robin Hood be able to get
him to talk about something


or someone other than himself?


Let's find out.


(chimes ringing)


- One fine day, Robin.


I'll do the yawn of touring
the Starship Fairy Dust.


There are many changes
I would make to it.


Oh, for the best.


- But I never asked.


- Tut-tut. You
don't have to ask.


I can tell just by
the look in your eyes


that you've been
working up the courage


to ask me to bless the
Starship with my presence.


Friends don't have
to ask, Robin.


I remember the little people.


- I didn't even get a
chance to say hello.


How could you have time
to look in my eyes and-


- I only need one
momentary glance.


Do you know why?


- Oh, sweet, sugary snow bells.


Don't ask him why, dude.


- I wasn't gonna.


- I'm glad you asked, sir.


One word, three
syllables, acumen.


- Well, I always found
cumin to be a little spicy.


- I see what you did
there. (chuckling)


Not cumen. Acumen.


It means the ability
to make good judgements


and quick decisions, typically
in a particular domain.


I don't expect a simpleton
such as yourself to know that,


but that's why I'm here.


To teach, to share
knowledge, to enlighten.


- I have no idea what he's
going on about. Like none.


Figuring out would be a
real feather in my cap.


- Yeah, good luck
with that. (laughing)


- Uh, Mr. Fox, as much
as I'd like to discuss


the ins and outs of the
Starship Fairy Dust with you,


I'm actually here on
official Fairytale Fun Force-


- Business. Yes, I know.


I went to the finest
business school in the world.


I'm well versed in
every type of business.


- How about noneya?


- Noneya?


- None ya business!
Ha! (laughing)


- Mr. Fox, when was
the last time you spoke


with Blunderboar the Giant?


- Blunderboar, that's
such a large fellow.


A dear friend.


A misunderstood fellow.


I did him a real
favor yesterday.


- Favor?


Go on.


- Yesiree.


You see, I overheard that
Dorothy from the Land of Oz


was thinking of putting
on a flying monkey show.


- Of course you did.


What's so interesting
about that?


- Dear sir, have you
no social skills?


Everyone knows that
a giant's worst enemy


is a flying monkey.
- Say what?


- Oh, ye of little
acumen. (laughing)


Flying monkeys are
the only creatures


who can successfully
remove the wax


from the giant's ears.


In fact, they really
eat the wax up.


- Um, first, ew.


Second, that sounds
like a win-win.


The flying monkeys
get fed and the giants


get their ears cleaned out.


- You're forgetting
one vital detail.


- Why am I still here?


I mean, like, I could
be anywhere else.


- I exude animal magnetism.


I'm irresistible.


Go ahead. Try.


I dare ya.


See? You can't.


It's the tail. So fluffy.


Majestic!


- Mr. Fox, what is the
detail I'm missing?


- Yes, thank you, good sir.


Where was I?


- The vital detail.


- Ugh, I'm getting a
headache. (chuckling)


- Ah, yes, yes, of course.


You see, giants
need their ear wax.


It's the only thing
that prevents their ears


from popping at high altitudes,


and giant's heads are
always at high altitudes


because they're so tall.


- Woo-hoo!


I think that may have just
been the info that I needed.


- Of course it was.


The world needs to hear
every single word I say,


every syllable.


I can solve any problem,
climb any mountain.


- That's it. I'm
outta here. (laughing)


- And take me with you!


Please take me with you.


- Captain's travel log,
star date 50-40-30, hike!


First mate Robin Hood
has returned to the ship


with a vital bit of information.


We now know what
Blunderboar's motive is.


But is it too late?


Has he imprisoned Dorothy in Oz,


never to return
to the real world?


Um, flying monkeys eat
giant ear wax deposits?


I'm gonna totally barf.


- I've had to barf ever since
Mr. Fox started talking.


Please tell me we have
an ice pack on board.


- What should we
do now, Captain?


I have an idea!


Why don't we speak
with Doodley Digs?


He knows how to
deal with every kind


of otherworldly
creature, even giants!


- Shhh!


I'm trying to
think here, Arthur,


and I can't do it with
your constant chatter.


I have an idea.


Why don't we speak
with Doodley Digs?


He knows how to
deal with every kind


of otherworldly
creature, even giants.


- You are an idea machine, Snow.


- But I-


- That's why I am
the captain, Robin.


- Setting travel
dials to Game World.


- Set travel dials
to Game World galaxy!


- Yes, ma'am.


Faster than we can
take from the greedy


and give to the needy.


- Mirrors and apples, let's go!


- Aye, aye.


- Full speed ahead!


- Do you really
think that Doodley


will be able to help?


I mean, he doesn't even realize


that he's a video
game character.


- He may be kind of strange
and his methods are,


shall we say, unique?


But Doodley always
saves the day.


- We have officially
reached warp factor five.


Fairytale Fun Force, go!


- Hold onto your
hats! (laughing)


- [Narrator] The adventure
continues in one of the most


action-packed universes
ever, the Game World galaxy!


Can the universe's greatest
hero, Doodley Digs,


help the Fairytale
Fun Force undo all of


Blunderboar's misdeeds?


(game beeping)


- Wow! Snow White!


You're back again!


What's shakin', bacon?


- Oh, Doodley!


We have another huge problem,


and you're the only
one who can help.


- Holy one up mushrooms.


Is it another Jabberwock?


- Nope.


We have a giant rampaging
through the universe!


- A giant? Holy cow!


I may need my bouncing boots.


Wait.


Maybe a grappling hook
will do the trick.


Thank the game gods
I don't need quarters


to play anymore.


Giants are tough.


Beating them can cost a fortune.


- So you have beaten
a giant before?


- If you can think of
it, I've beaten it off.


- You really are a hero.


- Two questions.


One, what is this giant doing?


And two, is it Blunderboar?


Please say it isn't.


- Unfortunately,
it is Blunderboar.


Is that extra bad?


- Well, yeah, but only
because Blunderboar


is the most stubborn
giant in the universe.


That and he tries to
eat anyone or anything


smaller than he is.


- Oh, my!


- What's older
Blunderboar up to now?


- Be warned, this is
a pretty weird story.


- Snow, you're talkin' to
someone who's faced off


against mushroom soldiers,


ridden in high-octane
hovercrafts through
floating cities,


and helped some dude in
a cheesy leisure suit


find the love of his life.


There's nothing too
weird or strange for me.


- Okay, you asked
for it. (laughing)


- I did.


- So, my cousin
Dorothy splits her time


between her home
in Kansas and Oz.


- I know Dorothy.


She totally let me
borrow her ruby slippers


one day so I could walk on lava.


- You can walk on lava
with ruby slippers?


- With hers you can.


They're enchanted.


- Ah!


Okay, so according to Mr. Fox.


- Ugh, him. (chuckling)


- No kidding! (laughing)


Old Foxy told Blunderpants
that Dorothy was


gonna put on a
flying monkey show.


That got Blunderboar's
pants in a bunch.


- Why does he have something
against flying monkeys?


- Apparently flying monkeys
love to eat giant earwax.


It's like a delicacy
or something.


- Um.


Ew.


- Totally. Ew.


Giants need their earwax
so that their ears


don't pop when they're
at high altitudes,


but being that they're so tall,


giants are always
at high altitudes.


Without their earwax,
their heads would be


non-stop popping.


- And because of this,
Blunderboar decided


to stop Dorothy from putting
on the flying monkey show.


- Correct.


- I'm almost afraid to ask,


but how did he go about
stopping the show?


Did you ask him to stop?


- Mirrors and apples, we tried.


But just like the magic
bow, he's hidden. (laughing)


First, he boosted
Cupid's magic bow


from the Love Planet
and then he used it


to shoot a magic arrow
through the Hatter's tea set


in Wonderland, thereby soaking
said magic arrow in tea,


and then he used
that tea-soaked arrow


to bamboozle the body
of the Cheshire Cat,


who was the final
magic ingredient needed


to lock Dorothy in Oz.


- Holy one up
mushrooms! That's a lot!


Wait.


Cheshire Cat has a body?


- (laughing) That's
what everyone says!


- Wow!


This all sounds pretty drastic


and thoroughly complicated.


I feel bad for whomever
had to think all that up.


- [Narrator] Hey, all.
Mind if I interrupt?


- Sure, Narrator. What's up?


- [Narrator] I just
checked on our writer.


He's currently
sitting in the corner,


slapping his tongue.


I think the effects
of Blunderboar's spell


are starting to affect him, too.


- Whoa!


If they don't finish writing,
this story will never end!


- Tell him we're on
the case, Narrator.


- [Narrator] Okay, he's
back at the keyboard.


Please continue.


- I have to say, Snow,
this is the craziest thing


I've dealt with since
my girlfriend Lara


was captured by power
mad druids and forced


to crawl up an ice mountain
covered in slippery oil, ah!


- Yikes!


- Ah, I hate to do this, but uh,


I think you may need,
um, a cheat code.


- A what?


- A cheat code.


It's what us heroes resort to
when there's no other choice.


- Do you really think that
one of those could help us?


- I think it may be the
only hope of ever freeing


Dorothy from the land of Oz.


- My cousin will not
spend the rest of her life


wandering a yellow brick
road with a tin can,


a straw dude, and a scaredy-cat.


A cheat code it is!


How does it work
and what will it do?


- I'm gonna send it
to your starship now.


Once you're back
and see the email,


tell Santa to run the
cheat code through


the elve's computer.


That should override
whatever spell is keeping


Blunderboar hidden.


- And once we know
where Blunderboar is,


we can start trying to
fix this mess! (laughing)


- Exactly! (laughing)


Okay, mental email sent.


Go back to your ship,
give it to Santa,


and good luck.


- Thanks, Doodley.


Be careful out there, and
watch out for raids gone wrong.


- Always!


- Captain's travel log,
star date 00-00-01, hike!


Doodley Dig supplied
us with a cheat code


that we can give to Santa
that will locate Blunderboar.


We are one step closer to
fixing this latest kerfuffle.


Arthur, zap me my email.


- I just sent it directly to
your mind so you don't have to


read it off of a screen.


You'll just remember
what it said.


- Isn't the future
awesome? (laughing)


- What next, Captain?


- Bring me up Santa
at the North Pole


and put him on speaker.


- What's the magic word?


- The magic word is I'm
the captain of this ship.


Now do as I say!


- That will work, too.


(buttons beeping)


- [Santa] Ho-ho. Hello?


- Hey, Mr. C. It's Snow.


- [Santa] Snow-ho-ho!


I was just thinking about you.


Have you made any
headway in fixing


this intergalactic mess?


My elves have come up empty.


- I have.


Doodley Digs gave me a
cheat code to give to you


to give to your elves
that will override


whatever cloaking spell
Blunderboar is using.


- [Santa] Ho-ho-ho! Excellent!


What's the code?


- Okay, ready?


Have your elves enter
this into their computer.


Down, down, up, up,


right, left, right, left,


A, B, enter.


- Whoa!


I think that's sort
of the same codes


I used to use in my Kong Mommy
games to get bonus lives!


- [Santa] Transmitting
them the cheat code now.


Stand by.


- Please let this work.


Please, oh, please, oh, please.


- The suspense is killing me!


- You can't see it, but
inside of my costume


I'm shaking like a leaf!


- Crossing fingers and toes.


Hey, Narrator, can you ask
the kids at home watching


to do the same?


- [Narrator] Of course.


Please, everyone, if
you're watching this,


cross all of your
fingers and toes.


Have your mommies and
daddies do it, too.


We need all of the
good vibes we can get.


- [Santa] Bingo-ho-ho-ho!


- (gasping) It worked?


- [Santa] It sure did.


According to the elves,
Blunderboar is, um, uh.


Well, isn't that a
kick in the tushy?


- What is? (laughing)


- [Santa] Blunderboar is
right where he should be,


the Land of Giants.


- Mirrors and apples!


How did we not think
of that? (laughing)


Thanks, Santa.


Thank the elves for us, too.


- [Santa] Well, good luck.


- Red, you know what to do.


- We'll huff and we'll
puff and we'll take


Blunderboar down!


- [Narrator] The next stop
on this incredible journey


where everyone thinks
big, the Land of Giants.


And before you know it,
the Starship Fairy Dust


makes touchdown in the
biggest place in the universe.


Snow White makes the
decision to send Robin Hood


out to deal with
Blunderboar because,


and I quote, she's too
cute to possibly get eaten.


- I think I need
my own starship.


Every time there's something
dangerous going on,


Captain Snow sends
either me or King Arthur.


It's usually me, though.


I mean, aren't I too
cute to be eaten, too?


- Ah! Someone say eat?


- Oh, um. Hi, Blunderboar.


How are you, big guy?


- Mmm, Blunderboar fine now.


Dodge bullet.


- Someone shot at you?


- Blunderboar use expression.


No one shoots at Blunderboar.


- Oh, good to hear.


Besides, they need something
to shoot at you with.


Something like, I don't
know, Cupid's magic bow?


- Uh-oh.


Blunderboar thinks he blundered.


Must've been found out.


- That's right. The jig is up!


- Jig?


Oh, Blunderboar doesn't
dance like Irishmen.


- No, that's just
another expression,


like you used shoot.


- Little man should save breath.


Blunderboar not sorry he
stopped earwax marauders


from giving Blunderboar
permanent headache.


- We know the whole
scheme, Blunderboar.


And we need to fix this
whole mess you've created.


- What mess?


Blunderboar just borrow stuff.


Blunderboar will
give back stuff.


Blunderboar can't take chance


flying monkey show go on road.


- Did you ask permission to
borrow Cupid's magic bow,


Hatter's tea set and
Cheshire Cat's body?


- Blunderboar still shocked
floaty cat head had body.


Who knew?


Besides, no harm done,
other than Dorothy


stay put with flying monkeys.


- No harm?


Cupid is beside himself,
Hatter is a mess,


and Cheshire is, well, Cheshire.


- Blunderboar cause trouble?


- Narrator, get the
Hatter on the phone


and put him on speaker.


- [Narrator] Calling the Hatter.


(phone ringing)


- [Hatter] If you
sneeze while traveling


at 60 miles per hour,
your eyes are closed


for an average of 50 feet.


- See? All he does is
quote strange facts!


- [Hatter] Your nose is
always visible to you.


Your mind ignores it
through a process called


unconscious selective attention.


- Wow! Aye, is that true?


Does Blunderboar
always see nose?


- That doesn't matter.


What matters is that everyone
gets their stuff back


and Dorothy is free
to return from Oz.


- Mmm, let Blunderboar think.


Blunderboar much
faster thinker now.


Should only take 41
hours, two minutes,


and 31 seconds.


- Sorry, Blunderboar,
but we don't have


that kind of time.


Things need to go
back to normal.


Who knows what else will
come of you tinkering


with the natural flow of things.


- Blunderboar make decision!


- And? (chuckling)


- Blunderboar will
not give stuff back.


Dorothy must stay in
Oz with flying monkey.


Blunderboar's earwax demands it.


- Don't you realize what
will definitely happen


if Dorothy has to stay in Oz?


- Mmm, Blunderboar not know.


- Her earth family
will miss her,


and she will miss them.


That means that there will
be no more birthday parties


for them, and even worse,
no more Christmases.


There will be an empty chair


where Dorothy
would normally sit.


No hugs, no laughs, no kisses.


Only tears.


- Oh, Blunderboar
not think of that.


- You don't wanna
make everyone sad.


Do you, Blunderboar?


- No. (sobbing)


- There, there, big guy.


You have plenty of
time to fix this.


You just have to
give everything back


to their rightful owners,


and apologize for taking
their stuff without asking.


- Blunderboar do it.


Oh, Blunderboar no
want to be known


as big stinker.


- Can I take everything
back with me to my ship?


- Tiny man in silly green
clothes can have stuff back.


Blunderboar will
have Jack bring stuff


to tiny man's sky car, eh?


(dog barking)


- I didn't know you had a dog.


- Blunderboar get
puppy from Geppetto.


Blunderboar soon
teach Jack to talk.


- Thanks, Jack.


And thank you, Blunderboar.


- Welcome.


Now Blunderboar go
make sorry calls.


- Good.


And now it's time to exit
stage get me outta here.


- [Snow White]
Captain's travel log,


star date 68-69-70, hike.


Robin Hood brought back
all the missing items,


and we've successfully brought
them back to their owners.


Well, except for
the Cheshire's body.


It just kind of
scampered off somewhere.


Still can't believe he had one.


- Great captaining today,
Captain. (laughing)


- A captain's gotta captain.


- And good work staring down


that mean, ol'
giant, Robin Hood.


- Hush. Only I'm allowed to
give out accolades on this ship.


Good work staring down that
mean, ol' giant, Robin Hood.


- That's a feather in my cap.


- It's time to visit my
distant cousin Dorothy


in the Land of Oz.


I wanna check in on her
and make sure she's okay.


Besides, I want the skinny
on this flying monkey show.


- Setting travel dials now.


- Let's get cooking.


- Hold on tight.


Putting the pedal to the metal.


Extreme zoom in two seconds!


- [Narrator] The Starship
Fairy Dust speeds away


to the sometimes home of
one of the most famous


characters in the
whole wide world.


That's right, it's
time for Snow White


to chat up her
distant cousin Dorothy


in the wonderful world of Oz.


(chimes ringing)


- Hey, cousin. Are you okay?


- Oh, my.


Snow White, I owe
you like big time.


- Yes, you do.


Now then, lavish me with praise.


- You're startin' to sound
like Mr. Fox. (laughing)


- Hey!


- Just kiddin'.


You really pulled my tushy
out of the oven. (laughing)


I love Oz, but I
love my family, too.


- Yeah, Thanksgiving
wouldn't have been


the same without you.


So tell me about this
infamous flying monkey show.


- Ugh.


Speaking of that
no good Mr. Fox,


if he would just listen
instead of constantly


speaking sometimes, we'd all
have a lot less headaches.


He basically caused
this whole kerfuffle.


- I mean, yeah, but how so?


- The flying monkey show
was an Oz exclusive.


I told him I was organizing it.


But here's the kicker.


Monkeys can only fly in Oz.


Blunderboar's earwax was
always safe and sound


inside of his noggin.


- You're kidding?


- Nope. (laughing)


As long as giants
don't visit Oz,


they have nothin'
to worry about.


- Ugh, so silly.


- Yup.


I was almost locked her my
whole life over nothin'.


- Did you tell Blunderboar
what really happened?


Did he apologize?


- Yup. He really was sorry.


In fact, he was so sorry,
he sent over a dozen jars


of giant earwax for the
flying monkeys to feast on.


- I thought he needed the wax.


- Oh, he does.


He's just stayin' home
until more builds up


in his giant-size
noggin. (laughing)


- Wow! What a mess.


One day that Mr. Fox
is gonna get his.


- We can only hope.


- Alrighty, cous.


I'm glad you're safe and
things are back to normal.


- Me, too.


I felt really bad for Hatter,


but I'd be lyin' if
I said he wasn't like


super informative. (laughing)


- Right? (laughing)


- Did you know that
in September 2007,


a guy named Kevin Shelley
broke 46 wooden toilet seats


with his head in one minute
to set a world record?


- No, but I do now! (laughing)


- Alrighty, Snowball.


I know you need to
get back to your ship.


- Yeah, my crew is pretty
much lost without me.


- Can you do me one last
favor once you're back aboard?


- Sure.


- Say hello to that
dreamy King Arthur for me.


He's just adorable
in his suit of armor.


(Snow White laughing)


- Uh-oh, somebody's got a crush!


- Maybe just a little
one. (laughing)


- Will do. See ya soon!


Captain's travel log,
star date 12-31-72, hike!


Another adventure is
in the history books


because of me.


And yeah, I guess that
my crew had a tiny bit


to do with it, too.


Speaking of them, it's time
for me to tell King Arthur


about his secret
admirer. (laughing)


Once again the Fairytale
Fun Force has saved the day.


- By the power of my
faithful Excalibur!


Totally did.


- This was a true team
effort, led by me, of course.


- Yup, you did all the
work, as per usual.


- Indeed.


Hey, Arthur.


- Yes?


- Did you know that you
have a secret admirer?


- What?


- Yeah, Hatter told me when
he was spouting strange facts.


- Who is it?


- I don't know. I gave
him back his tea set


before he had time to tell me.


I guess we'll never know.


- Are you sure that we don't
need that tea set for anything?


You know, maybe we
can use it to save


a kingdom or something.


- Now, now, we don't
use any of the tools


at our disposal
for personal gain.


- But! (laughing)


- (laughing) But nothin'.


Red, take us home.


- Fairytale Fun Force, go!


- [Narrator] And one
thing's for sure.


With this zany crew and
this galaxy of weirdos,


the next adventure is
just around the corner.


It's also gonna be
more fun than anyone


ever could've guessed.


Until next time, excelsior!
