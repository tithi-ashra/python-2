I'm so excited
you're getting engaged!


Well, she has to say yes first.


Which she will,
once you ask.


You still asking tonight, right?


Call me when you pop
the question.


And text me your address.


I'm sending something

You know, I'm so happy
I finally finished filming,


and we get the next
two weeks together.


Mm-hmm.
With no work interruptions.


I love the holidays.


[sighs] This is perfect.


You know FaceTime hugs
are just not the same.


You know,
kisses aren't the same either.


-Mm-mm.Oh.

That's my mum. Hey.


FAYE OVER PHONE:
Maddie, could you pick up
some champagne on your way home?


-Okay.
-FAYE OVER PHONE: See you soon.


-Okay.
-FAYE OVER PHONE: Love you.


Bye. She wants us
to get champagne.


Okay, I'll add a stop

So, champagne huh?
What are we celebrating?


Maybe that I'm home
for the holidays this year.


Well, you've been a little busy
the last two years


-just making movies.
-Hm, but I'm here now.


And there's nothing like
Christmas in Oregon!


We can do sledding.


Uh, snowball fights.
Oh, and caroling.


It's an annual tradition
in our neighborhood.


The Vetters always win.


All of that sounds perfect.
Except for the caroling part.


I may or may not have a fear
of singing in public.


You can always just mouth
the words.


Or just drink
a nice Oregon Pinot


while everyone else sings.


-Hey, speaking of wine...
-Mm-hmm.


I planned a day
of tasting for us later.


Followed by
a romantic candlelit dinner.


Oh, sign me up.


[♪♪♪]


BRYCE:
Ah, thanks.


Nice Bronco.


That is my dad's third child.


-[♪♪♪]
-[indistinct chattering]


Hey uh, you sure it's okay
if I stay at your parents'?


I always do.


[indistinct chatter, shouting]


-Actually, book the hotel room.
-On it.


FAYE:
Maddie! Is that you?
We're in here.


FAYE:
Madison! What do you think?


I think you're wearing
your wedding dress.


[Faye chuckles]


JOSH:
They're here!


Merry Christmas.


Ah, you brought the champagne.
Wait, I'll get the glasses.


Bryce, what do you think?


Uh, well ma'am,
I think that it uh...


It... It will-- it certainly--


It is a perfect introduction
to my family.


-Ah.
-[chuckles]


Mom, this is Bryce.


And Bryce,
this is my mom, Faye.


Oh, it's a pleasure
to meet you, Bryce.


Thank you for the champagne.


Be a dear
and open it for us, will you?


-Sure thing, Faye.
-He's a keeper.


But mom, why the champagne?
And the dress?


And why are Josh's parents
and the neighbors


-in the dining room? I don't...
-[chuckles]


-That's a question for--
-HARPER: I'm engaged!


-Yes, engaged!
-[bottle pops]


What?


-Oh boy.
-Oh.


-[Madison laughs]
-[Harper laughs]


Oh! Oh my goodness now!


Oh!


Bryce, oh!


It is so good to see you.


And now we have even more
to celebrate.


I'm getting married in two days!


-[Faye chuckles]
-What?


-Yes!
-Uh, two days?


-[telephone ringing in distance]
-Isn't it so exciting?


I better get that.
It's been a crazy day.


There's so many people
to talk to.


[sighs] Two days.


-By the way, I'm Josh.
-Good to meet you, Bryce.


I liked your heartfelt speech
at your reunion.


-You did?
-Yeah. Saw it several times.


It's all over Facebook.
It was good.


Thanks.
Maybe a tad too long, but um...


Hey, congrats
to the happy groom!


Oh. No, no, no.
I'm not the fiancé.


No, I'm Harper's best friend,
since we were kids.


I feel like
I'm a few steps behind.


Oh Bryce, would you be a dear
and get us some more wood?


Roger has it.
He's out back. Thanks.


Yeah.


Great.


[♪♪♪]


MADISON:
How did you get engaged?


[exhales] It was...
it was like a dream.


Noah called last night
from London.


He said that he can't stand


to spend one more day
without me.


And would I be his forever?


Ooh.


I saw a pair of geese
yesterday morning.


And they mate for life,
you know.


So, it was a sign that Noah
was going to propose.


-That is so romantic. But--
-I know, right?


He wants to get married
this weekend.


I-- and it's even more perfect
that you and Bryce


are here for Christmas.


There's no time like
the present. Right?


The present is a present.


That's what Noah always says.


Oh, did I mention
he has a British accent?


-Oh, that is adorable.
-He is adorable.


[both chuckles]


What do mom and dad
think about it?


You know dad. [sighs]


Stay away from boys.


No, no dating till senior year.


Mm, being home always
brings back so many memories.


Do you remember your prom?


How I made you change your dress
before your date arrived.


Oh.


Still the right call.
Pink is just not my friend.


Oh, he forgot to get you
a corsage.


Right.


Billy Richards.


His long hair. [chuckles]


Easy on the eyes,


but not big
in the brains department.


But Josh came to the rescue,


went to the kitchen
and got...


Radishes!


[Bryce clears throat]


Mr. Belle, uh sir,


I have a very important
question to ask you


about Madison.


Madison is the love
of my life.


[panting]


BRYCE:
And I'd like to ask
for your blessing.


I want to marry Madison.

BRYCE:

[bottles clanking]


Here you go.


Gotta say this.


A pleasure to finally meet you,
Mr. Belle. Uh, sir.


What's with the formality?
We're all friends here.


Just call me "sir."


I'm Roger.

[coughs, clears throat]


Twelve percent alcohol.
Brewed it myself.


Ah, never tasted anything
quite like it.


-Phew.
-[Madison laughs]


I can't believe this is
actually happening for me.


-I'm getting married.
-In two days.


I know I just met him
a few months ago. But...


Ah, did I mention his
British accent?


It's adorable, I know.


[both chuckles]


[sighs]


Maddie,
I really thought you


and Bryce would
get engaged first.


No older sis wants
to get beat to the altar.


No need to rush
on my account.


[gasps] It's him. Noah.


Hello, hello,
my little buttercup.


-Maddie is here.
- Hello, Madison.


Congratulations, Noah.
Very exciting news.


[gasps] Maddie, oh!


It's bad luck to toast
with an empty glass.


Oh sorry, I look forward
to seeing you later,


-Noah. Bye.
-[knocking on door]


NOAH:
Sadly, my flight was cancelled.


Harper, I'm not gonna get there
until tomorrow.


Oh, no.


-Noah baby, no.
-None of that.


HARPER:
You're gonna miss
our special dance


-with Miss Rosa today.
-NOAH: Chin up.


HARPER:
I love you.


NOAH:
Not as much as I love you.


-No, I love you more.
-NOAH: I love you more.


-Times infinity.
-Times infinity plus one.


BRYCE:
Ah.


-Phew.
-My side down.


There we go.


-Grab that for me, Bryce.
-Yeah.


[birds chirping in distance]


Don't worry.


I'm a third generation
timber man.


People in my family never miss.


The trick to safely splitting
a log


is always making the new guy
hold the spike.


-I'm kidding.
-[chuckles]


But seriously, don't move.


Would now be a--
a good time to chat?


Anything to get away
from this wedding talk.


No wedding talk. Got it.


But seriously,


is it too much to ask that
before a couple get married,


their parents meet?


Sounds reasonable to me.


I mean, you know,
family is important.


Family is everything.


You're not just marrying
the person.


You're marrying the family.


Couldn't have said it better
myself.


-[cellphone buzzing]
-Oh ah, I'm sorry.


[clears throat, sniffles]


ROGER:
Is that an emergency?


[chuckles] No. No, no.
It can wait.


[♪♪♪]


Hm.


-Aah.
-Ah.


[♪♪♪]


BRYCE:
Uh yeah, hi.
If you could uh--


Oh no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no.


BRYCE:
Just go ahead
and cancel that reservation.


Okay, yeah, thank you.


Thanks for helping
with Harper's wedding.


This isn't how I wanted


to spend our first day
back together.


Oh, come on, I actually
assumed when we got here


we'd spend the entire time
dress shopping


[door squeaking]


-Wow.
-Does "best available"


just not mean
what I think it means?


This is better


than even our room
in Alabama!


-[chuckles]
-[door squeaking]


[sighs]


VIDEO NARRATOR:
We're so happy you've chosen


the Cedartown Lodge
as your home away from home.


We hope you find the time
to enjoy our local attractions.


Good day, mates!
Zane Thomas here.


And I'm excited to see
all your lovely faces here


at Zaneyards.


Oh, what the?


That's Zane's Vineyards,
only better.


That's right, I make wine.


Great wine, in fact like,
my award-winning Zanefandel.


That's Zane's zinfandel,
only sexier.


Mmm.


Check out the legs
on this beauty.


You know you want
to taste it.


BRYCE:
Why is your ex-boyfriend doing
a commercial for a winery?


When we started dating,
he bought a winery


-to impress my dad.
-Oh, good.


Didn't work. But tasty wines.


Hm. You know I wanna taste it.


[cellphone buzzing]


-Oh, it's David!
-Mm-hmm.


Hey, there.


-DAVID: You're not Bryce.
-What gave it away?


Hm.


-Hey, where are you?
-Oh ah...


Me? Nowhere.


Ah well,


Maddie's sister got engaged
last night


to her boyfriend
of three months.


[clears throat]
And they're getting married


-this weekend.
-DAVID: As in this weekend?


-Yes, it's all very exciting!
-[sighs]


Don't worry.
I'm still asking her tonight.


Um, hey David,
we actually have to run.


-Got a wedding dress to find.
-Make good choices.


[chuckles]


[♪♪♪]


HARPER:
Oh, it's perfect.


Church, check.
Band, check.


Dress, check.


Mom's handling the flowers.
And Noah's on the cake.


Oh, I love it when a plan
comes together


with time to spare.


Oh, let's give Bryce a tour
of Main Street.


There just happens
to be a cute little place


-for hot chocolate.
-And Christmas cookies.


Excuse me, Ms. Belle.


Would you mind taking
a photo with us?


Yeah, of course.
You can call me "Madison".


-I'll catch up with you guys.
-[Child 1 chuckles]


My sister's such a big fan.


This place is so charming.


-It reminds me of my hometown.
-Oh.


Yeah, I couldn't imagine
living anywhere else.


Ah, this is where Maddie
used to act in the plays


growing up.


Yeah. [chuckles]


I do love being a teacher.


I... I get to act encourage
their creativity.


Bryce, um....


I just want to let you know
that


I'm really glad you came home
with Maddie for Christmas


It means everything
to my parents


that you guys are here.


And truthfully, it means
everything that you


and Maddie are helping me
plan my wedding.


-Of course.
-[kids chattering]


So much of my life has been...


spent watching
my sister shine,


watching her accomplish
so many great things.


She's amazing.


She's an honest
to God star now.


[chuckles]


I'm just kind of hoping that...


this one weekend
can be about me.


-What'd I miss?
-Oh!


Not a thing.


So, who is ready
for some dancing?


Ooh, dancing does sound fun.


But we're still getting
hot chocolate first, right?


This-- this kid
and his chocolate.


-What? I'm serious.
-[laughs]


You said we're getting
hot chocolate.


[all applauds]


-Awesome!
-Nice.


Now, the bride
and groom dance.


Great job, dad.


Where's the groom?


Well, unfortunately,
his flight was delayed.


It's not easy to do
a couple's dance


without the couple.


Rosa, why don't we take a video
and we could send it to Noah.


I mean, anybody should be
able to do the rumba, right?


And Josh can fill in
for Noah now.


Or Bryce can,
if you prefer.


Ah, I can handle myself.


It's gonna be great.


You make movies, right?


I'm an agent,
not a cinematographer.


Uh, yeah.


[clears throat]


Okay folks, showtime.


-Thanks, Josh.
-Yeah, no worries.


-Um, alright.
-[bangs]


[♪♪♪]


I wasn't expecting you
to be so light on your feet.


It's easy when you have
the right partner.


Hey, remind me, what class


did they take together
in high school again?


-Was it chemistry?
-Mm.


[♪♪♪]


[all applauding]


Nice job. Well done.


Oh, thanks.


ROSA:
How about you, Ms. Madison?


Does my other star student
still have it?


Oh, I still got it.


Just not sure my partner
can keep up.


Oh well, challenge accepted.


-Okay.
-ROSA: I'll get you some shoes.


BRYCE:
Hey, give us a few minutes
to warm up.


[exhales]


So, are you sure there's
no history


between Harper and Josh?


-They're friends.
-Uh-huh.


MADISON:
And in case you forgot,


Harper's getting married
this weekend to Noah.


[chuckles]
But they just started dating.


[thumps]


All I'm saying is,


I'm not sure
why Noah had to rush.


[thumping]


It's romantic.


And what's wrong
with commitment?


With wanting a future
with someone?


Nothing, but the timing
has to be right.


Hey, wait.


Do you think I don't want that?


We're still talking about
Harper and Noah, right?


It's better to try and fail
than to never try at all.


You have to take risks...


-Ooh!
-Maddie!


For love.


Or, you might just miss


the window.


[loud thumping]


You know how much I love you.


And I'm so lucky
to be with you.


We're both lucky.


I'm pleasantly surprised.


I'm luckier.


-Sorry I picked a fight.
-No, no, no, I'm sorry.


I shouldn't have made fun
of Harper and Josh.


-Yeah.
-It was insensitive.


Right.


[pants]


I didn't have to jump
on you for that.


You're entitled to your opinion.


[Maddie groans]


You know what?


I think opinions,
they're overrated.


Oh. [pants]


Besides, you are worth the
risk, Maddie.


Hey, I know that it may not be
the perfect weekend to do it.


Oh, it is the perfect weekend
to do it.


Okay. Okay, okay.


But there's something that
I need to ask you and...


-Hmm.
-Well, it's-- it's


pretty important.


Well, I'm kinda busy right now.


Ah, okay. Yeah.


Oh well, I mean,
yeah baby,


it will just--
it will just take a minute.


It better take longer
than a minute.


Oh okay, yeah.


[smooches, moans]


MADDIE:
Oh. Ooh!


-[Madison chuckles]
-[sirens blaring]


-[firebrigade sirens blaring]
-[dogs barking]


Hmm.


[cellphone ringing]


-[gasps]
-[cellphone ringing]


[sighs]


HARPER:
What?


[cellphone buzzing]


-Harper, it's early.
-Maddie,


something terrible
has happened and,


we have to cancel the wedding.


Ah, okay. Okay, calm down.
What's wrong?


The church caught on fire
last night.


Someone left the candles
burning.


Okay, uh, I can fix that.


We can just find
a new location.


And mom texted me a picture
of the flowers.


They're all carnations!


Okay, I can fix that.
We can find different flowers.


And apparently,
there's something wrong


-with the cake.
-MADISON: I can fix that.


We'll go to the bakery.


And I um...


- I slept with Josh.
-[cellphone beeps]


I can't fix that.


Dreams are a powerful reflection
of our inner state of being.


-Dreams?
-HARPER: Yes.


I had a dream
that I slept with Josh.


What did you think I said?


Am I getting cold feet?


MADISON:
No, you're fine.


It was just a dream.
Pick me up in 15 minutes.


Sarah's on the other line.


SARAH:
Good morning.


-MADISON: Hey.
-Something's wrong.


My sister's getting married
tomorrow.


I'm your agent
and best friend.


-How did I not know this?
-Surprise engagement.


-On video chat.
-Oh.


Yeah, I would have preferred
the whole shebang.


Music, flowers, lights.


Camera and action.


MADISON:
And yesterday we tried
to throw together


all the wedding plans,
but...


More surprises?


The church burned down
last night, okay.


And we have to get
different flowers.


And a new cake.


[keyboard keys tapping]


Hey, what are you doing?


Checking flights.
You're amazing and all,


but there's no way you can
handle this by yourself.


I got you.


Really?


Apparently not.


I can't get there
until late tonight.


Sorry, Madison.


Did somebody say Madison?
As in, Madison Belle?


Then my boy Bryce
must be nearby.


How long were you standing
outside my office?


Madison!


I love this whole
devil-may-care morning-look


you got going on.


Hi, Larry.


I didn't know you got
to the office so early.


Little known fact.


I'm the worm that gets
the early birds.


Uh.


LARRY:
But ladies, if you need
a flight to Oregon,


I'm your man.


I'll just fire up the PJ


and zip you up there
in a couple of hours.


Alright. But I swear, Larry,


if you make one joke
about the mile-high club,


I will throw you off
that private jet.


Fair.


Hey Sarah,
I need tons of flowers.


Uh roses, hydrangeas.


No carnations.


Thank you.


I just love weddings.


You like weddings?


Couples pledging
their eternal love and fidelity?


Did I say weddings?
I meant bridesmaids.


I just love bridesmaids.


-Larry.
-And cake.


Cake is nice, too.


[scoffs]


[yawns]


Wedding fell apart overnight.


So, Sarah and Larry
are coming to help.


Oof. Uh, Larry never helps.


Trust me, he's only in it
for the bridesmaids.


Yeah, well,
joke's on him.


I'm the only one.


Hey, hey, hey.
Can uh-- can we talk?


MADISON:
Can it wait?


Harper's here.
And she really needs me.


And don't forget
you're meeting my dad


at the tux shop
in an hour.


Sure. Yeah, no problem.


[sighs]


Oh, and uh, by the way
will you marry me?


[groans]


[knock on door]


[clears throat]
You forget something?


[blows whistle]


Congratulations!
You're getting married!


You're getting married!
You're getting--


Could you keep it down?


You're getting married,
you're getting married.


-You're getting married!
-No, David.


DAVID:
What, where's Madison?


BRYCE:
Look, she had to run out


and help her sister
with something.


And...


I haven't had the chance
to ask her yet.


What about wine tasting
and the romantic dinner?


Ah well,
the first one was cancelled.


And the second one was uh...
cancelled.


Oh.


The sister getting married


really throws a wrench
into your plans,


doesn't it?


Hey, I'm so sorry you came
all this way for nothing, David.


You think I'd miss
my best friend


getting engaged
to the love of his life?


Psshh.


At least you got the parents'
blessing, right?


Ah well, yeah, yeah.
I was-- I was planning on it.


But then I thought,


do people even really
do that anymore.


Oh, trust me it's important.
It shows that you value family.


That her parents matter.


I-- I-- I know.
Look, I tried, alright.


I did, practiced a speech
and everything.


But when it came time
to give it,


her dad was furious about Noah.


It just, wasn't the right time.


Love waits for no man.


Mm-hmm.


It's time and tide
wait for no one.


I think it's the tide
always rolls.


Come on, man.


Listen, you do not find
the right time.


You make it.


-Oh.
-Yeah.


Oh, okay.
How do you propose I do that?


Oh, you do the proposing.
[chuckles]


I'll handle the rest.


[♪♪♪]


-Oh.
-I know.


It's not Alabama bacon.
That's not even edible bacon.


That's...


This is like...
auburn bacon.


I'm just not really sure
I want a lemon scone.


You talked the entire car ride
here about the scones?


What if I want
an almond croissant instead?


You said the lemon scones
were unique and different.


Almond croissants
are dependable.


[sighs]
And they never let you down.


Lemon scones can surprise you
with their zestiness.


Almond croissants
are so satisfying.


Lemon scones seem
to put a smile on your face.


Why do I have to make up
my mind so quickly?


What if I don't want
a lemon scone every single day


for the rest of my life?


What if I want
a blueberry muffin tomorrow?


Or, you know,
a chocolate éclair next week?


-Why not get one of each?
-[indistinct chatter]


Uh, two glazed donuts
and oat milk lattes, please.


Oh, and please tell Diana that


Harper's here to talk about
the wedding cake.


Thank you.


Anything you can do,
anything.


We don't have the time,
but you're family, Mr. Belle.


-Let me see what I can do.
-Thank you.


Thank you.


-[door squeaks]
-[door dings]


Roger.


-Good to see ya.
-Good to see you.


I want to introduce you
to David,


my best friend from Alabama.


He just uh, you know,


happens to be in Oregon
on business.


And David,
this is the Roger Belle,


-Madison's father.
-Ah.


[all chuckle]


-Oh.
-Pleasure to meet you, Roger.


Your daughter
is simply the best.


And she throws
a mean game of darts.


It takes real talent
to keep pace with Madison.


Bryce, went at it
with her last night, didn't you?


-Oh, sorry?
-You two sure can cut a rug.


Yeah, yeah. Uh, you know,
well, what can I say?


I'm a man
of many hidden talents.


TUXEDO EMPLOYEE:
Sorry, Mr. Belle.


It's the best we could do
on such short notice.


I understand.
If they fit, they'll do.


Uh, do you have anything
in my size?


Ah, I sure do.


Okay, gents,


wanna take a ride
with me when we're done here?


What's next on the list?


-It's a surprise.
-Ooh.


I like surprises.


It's the strangest thing.


The ceramic cake molds
cracked.


I've never seen anything
like it.


The molds just cracked?


So, can you just make
a different cake?


Yes, but it won't be the one
that Noah ordered


for the wedding.


He picked special antique cake
molds from our collection.


This is a sign, Maddie.


Is this wedding cursed?


No, the molds were old,
which is why they broke.


And that was very thoughtful
of Noah.


But we'll just take
whatever beautiful cake


you can make
for the wedding tomorrow.


-Absolutely.
-Thanks, Diana.


Oh, and can we get a box
of lemon scones to go, please?


Of course.


Okay.


[sighs] Noah wants to know
how things are going.


Tell him everything's going
to be just fine.


LARRY:
Madison!


MADISON:
You made it!


Hello, ladies.


Larry Berger,
here to save this wedding.


-Thank you.
-Here you go.


-We've got the flowers.
-Oh, thank you.


I will text you the address
of the new venue.


-You already found one?
-[sighs] Long story.


You can fill me in
as we drive to the nail salon.


I booked you mani-pedis.


We've got a wedding
to prepare for!


Never leave me.


[birds chirping]


Well, what do you think?


It's great. But don't you live
just one street over?


I could knock down the fence
and connect the backyards.


Ooh. Location,
location, location.


Josh did the deal.


He says
it's Harper's dream house.


It does have really nice
curb appeal.


Good yard.
Enough rooms for a big family.


And they used
Benjamin Moore Paint.


You really can feel the love.


Yeah. It's perfect.


It's my surprise wedding gift.


And your secret
is safe with us.


[♪♪♪]


[sighs]


You are amazing.


I mean it.


You saved everything.


Well the Belle sisters
can handle anything.


Now are you ready
to talk about Josh?


[sighs]


Did you see the way
he looked at me?


After our dance?


So, the rumba made you want
to tango?


So, we went back to his place
for a nightcap.


Just hanging out
like we always do.


One minute we're just--
we're listening


to some old mix CDs,


and the next


I'm dreaming of sleeping
with him.


This is a sign, right?


That is some mix CD.


Ah.


Do I have deep hidden feelings
for Josh?


I think I'm getting cold feet.


Wait, so a dream about Josh
gave you cold feet?


No.


Yes.


I mean, no?


I don't know.


Is Josh more than
your best friend?


Hey, are you in love with him?


No. It's Josh.


You know, he's just--
He's always been there.


And I don't want to lose him.


But I'm marrying Noah
tomorrow.


You're not gonna lose him


just because you're marrying
someone else.


Have you talked
to Josh about this?


I haven't had time
with all the wedding stuff.


Well, Sarah's on her way
to pick us up


to go to the rehearsal.


Josh's gonna be there.


I think you should talk to him.


[sighs]


Good idea.


[♪♪♪]


[indistinct chattering
in distance]


Why don't I get any wine?


Wine is for the wedding party,
Larry.


You said it was complimentary.


[indistinct chatter]


You alright, gentlemen?
You alright?


Ladies?


Hi.


Hi, David!


Good to see you.


Did I miss you
on the guest list?


-Fancy. Oh.
-Thanks, buddy.


I'm a last minute invite.


David!
What are you doing here?


-[chuckles]
-Oh!


Um, business trip.


In rural Oregon?


Uh, you know,


um, the glamorous life
of a serial entrepreneur.


Uh, dare I ask


what you promised Zane,
your ex-boyfriend


to have the wedding here?


You don't want to know.


[claps] Okay, people.


We've only got 30 minutes
to rehearse before dinner.


What's the groom's ETA?


He is in an Uber right now.


Okay.


Until he gets here,
who can stand in for the groom?


Oh, I can do it.


-He'll do.
-Me?


Oh, uh, I'm supposed
to escort Faye down the aisle.


Well, what do you think
I'm here for?


Well, okay.


-[♪♪♪]
-[birds chirping]


[Josh sighs]


First, the mother of the bride.


What a coincidence
you're here this weekend!


Oh. I love a winter wedding.


[Faye chuckles]


Madison, you're up.


And last but not least,
the bride and her father.


Hey, you okay?


Fine, just fine.


Harper, I know you.
Something's wrong.


[clears throat]


Just a second.


Yesterday...


our dance...


we were close.


-And?
-And...


the way you looked at me...


I felt...


Um...


did you feel?


-I uh...
-Okay.


I have it.


Tomorrow I'll start
with a few words


about importance of friendship
and the foundation of love.


And why communication
and honesty are necessary.


And then, you two
will exchange vows.


Oh, we wrote our own vows.


I mean, Noah
and I wrote our own vows.


OFFICIANT:
Oh, okay.


Um, well, no need
to practice them now. [chuckles]


Then after the vows,
you will exchange rings.


Oh, ah...


[♪♪♪]


OFFICIANT:
And then the moment
we've all been waiting for.


You may kiss the bride.


Josh.


Harper.


-Noah!
-Noah?


-HARPER: Oh.
-[family members cheering]


I'll take it from here.
Cheers, mate.


-Alright.
-Hi.


Oh, hi.


This...


is for you, my love.


[Sarah sighs]


Oh. [chuckles]


I want to be him
when I grow up.


Me too.


[indistinct chatter]


I can't believe nobody else
ordered the oysters.


They were delicious.


-Really?
-Yeah.


-FAYE: Great.
-[indistinct chatter]


So, yeah. Oh.


Josh?


-Thank you.
-Yeah, you're welcome.


[glass clinks]


Um, I just wanted to say that


tonight has been
the loveliest night,


filled with family
and friends.


Um, Harper and I are blessed


to have you all here tonight
and in our lives.


Aww.


Um, I've one final toast,
I'd like to make.


Ah... Or rather,
an announcement.


Um it's a bit of good news
to share actually.


Uh, not even Harper knows yet.


Um...


so ah,


-I got a promotion.
-[gasps]


-Oh.
-FAYE: Congratulations.


-HARPER: That's great.
-NOAH: Thank you. Thanks.


-HARPER: Sure.
-[all applaud]


Thank you.


Yeah, so after the wedding,


Harper and I
will be moving to London.


Excuse me, I... I need some air.


LARRY:
London is fantastic.


[indistinct chatter]


You're moving?


-We need to talk.
-Okay.


[truck engine starting]


Is it flooded?


Or uh, maybe the timing's off?


Timing is fine.
It's perfect, in fact.


Besides, what's a Hollywood
agent know about cars?


Well, my uncle's a mechanic.


And uh, I spent a lot of time
at his shop.


[blows]


There's a wrench
in the glove compartment.


-Yeah.
-[groans]


It's on there pretty snug.


Yeah, told you
the timing's not off.


Something's off, damn it!


[sighs]


You know,
the house really is great.


And I know Harper's gonna
love it.


We both know they're never
gonna move back here.


But thanks for saying it.


Maybe you
and Maddie can have it,


once you get around
to proposing


Wait, how did you...


-Does Madison know?
-Relax. [chuckles]


Maddie doesn't know.
Faye told me.


She overheard you proposing
to the dog.


Hey, Roger...


I want to marry Madison.


With your and Faye's blessing
of course.


Do you love her?


With all my heart.


Well then, son...


you have our blessing.


[truck engine roaring]


Well, guess we should go
rejoin the party, huh.


Time to bury the hatchet,
I suppose.


I don't say this often,
but I'm impressed.


You're good with cars
and you dance.


Don't tell me you can sing
like that Australian fellow too.


[Madison laughs]


NOAH:
Yeah, no worries.


Cheers!


Thank you, cheer.

Josh and I found this bridge
in middle school.


Yeah?


People had just started
leaving locks to declare


their undying love.


And I thought it was silly.


Of course,
Josh thought it was perfect.


So, he held up his bike lock


and said, "Will you
be my best friend forever?"


Of course, I told him that's
not what the locks are for,


but he insisted that they were.


And I said yes.


[chuckles]

his bike was stolen.


[chuckles]


[both chuckles]

Love is uncertain.

Dearly beloved,


we are gathered here today
to join this man


and this woman
in holy matrimony.


Love is a sacred thing.


It needs to be tended to,
like an orchid.


We search for it.


We fight for it.


-Sometimes, we pay for it.
-[coughs]


But I digress.


It's this special moment


when you find the person
that you want to


spend the rest
of your life with.


And if that person happens
to be your best friend


or your partner in crime,
hold onto them.


-I love you.
-I love you, too.


Marriage only ends in divorce
or death.


So, let's pray for death,
okay?


[all laugh]


LARRY:
Now, if anyone thinks
that these two


should not get married,


speak now
or forever hold your peace.


It's now or never, son.


Going once...


Great, let's hear some vows!

Are you okay?


Oh, well, my pride is bruised,


but I don't think
anything else is.


Wait, are we married yet?


No.


Since we were 13,


I've been scared that
I was gonna lose you.


I can't let you go
without telling you how I feel.


I love you...


and I will love you...


Forever.


Well, I love you
infinity plus one.


So...

You're handsome and kind.

is an adventure.

Winters in the mountains.


Every day, something new
and exciting.


Our life together
will be wonderful


I know.


It would be.


But I realized...


it's not the life that I want.


What I want...


what would make me...


truly happy every single day...


is an almond croissant.


Well then, I'll um...


take up baking lessons.


Doesn't come
as a total surprise,

I wanna face it with you.


-Madison, I--
-Apologies,


but we've got a problem.
The band's singer seems


to have hit the open bar
too hard.


Any ideas, Bryce?


Oh, it's a shame
that Australian fellow


that bought this vineyard
isn't here to save the day.


[sighs]


Would you excuse me
for a minute?


Okay.


[sighs]


Thank you.


Hey. [clear throat]


Excuse me,
I'm gonna jump on in here.


Guys, we're gonna just uh,
full punch it, right?


-Pull along, here we go.
-[guests applaud]


Speech! Speech!


But make it short.


Well uh, cheers
to the happy couple.


I'm so glad that
you risked it all.


And I really don't like
singing in public,


but Madison...
this one's for you.


Thank you.
