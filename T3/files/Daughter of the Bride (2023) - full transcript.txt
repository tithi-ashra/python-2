[Diane] I see you!


[laughs] I'm gonna get you!


I'm gonna get you!


I'm gonna get you!


Where'd she go? Boo!


[Kate screams]


I'm gonna get you.
I'm gonna get you.


[Kate screams]


I'm gonna get you. Ah?


Did you see where Katie went?
Oh, no.


[Kate] Look at those two...


laughing and giggling.


That is some pure love
right there.


I gotcha!


[Kate] I should know
because that pipsqueak


with the wide eyes
and pouty lips, that's me.


And the badass hottie?
That's my mom.


She met my father at a
juice bar near Copacabana.


He was the life of the party,
and she was up for anything.


They got hitched,
I got hatched,


and pretty soon after,
he got lost.


But, my mom said
it was no big deal


because we would
always have each other.

Hold on. Hold on.


Ohh!


I'm out, ladies. There's another
bad day for uniforms.


Will you tell your
grown ass daughter


to do her own damn shirts?


-My baby needs me.
-[Tom] Uh!


See if she can play next week.


Kathy's getting her

No, she's getting her
knee replaced. I have the hip.

-Mm-mm-mm.


It says she's here.


Ah! Yes!

-[Kate] Aaah!


Ha-ha!
I brought one for each of you.


Hey, Aunt Marci wants you
to sub-in at cards next week.

on life just yet.

-A chiropractor.
-Gross.


-Ew. True.
-Living, breathing human here.


Okay, so, one of the groomsmen
is recently divorced,


and the bride's brother
is a lawyer


with really good hair.

The lamb's extra juicy tonight.


-Yeah. Oh.
-Ooh! Baah!


Hey, guys, table fourteen,

[Mike] Oh!
[Diane] Hmm!


-She's good.
-Mm-hm.


-You are good.
-I just know what you want.


-Hm. And what is that?
-Janie, you want a puppy.


-Adorable, doting, and loyal.
-Yes, very true.


[Diane] Kate wants
a carnival goldfish.


Shiny, immediate,
and temporary.


Mm. And what do you want?


I'm good.
I've got everything I need.


Oh, she didn't ask
what you need,


she asked what do you want.


[scoffs] If I wanted anything,
it would be a unicorn.


But they don't actually exist,
so I'm good.


-I'm gonna miss this, ladies.
-Oh.


-Bullshit!
-Bullshit!

I don't know.
I don't know.


Do I look like I know
anything about cars?


Cars are just like people.
They like to be understood.


Okay.


Not so much about fixing it
as understanding it...


[engine starts]


Or in your case, unlocking
the steering wheel.


-Take care.
-All right, then.

Well, easy is boring.

daddy issues,


but I'm not interested
in sleeping with someone


to address them.


Hm.


This is my mom.


I think you two might
hit it off.


Your mom? Ah!


Did this just get weird?


Well, I think it
just got interesting.


Right.


Well, uh,
see you around.


-Have a good evening.
-Okay.

[exhales] through your mouth.


-She hasn't responded.
-Holy co-dependence.


You can return to this
throughout the day whenever


you need to reset.


I've barely seen her
whole month.

Hmm.


[dramatic music]


-[Diane] Oh, no.
-What?


Is the driver lost? I mean,


how many times have we
ordered from that place?


[phone chimes]


Oh, no.
Um, you know what?


I... actually have... Oh!
I have a headache.


-Oh, I'll get some Advil.
-No!


Uh, I'm just gonna go upstairs
and, you know, rest.


-Um, let's do a rain check.
-Okay.


I'll just finish my laundry
and head out.


No, no! I'll do it.
I'll do it.


-I need shirts for the weekend.
-[Diane] Yeah.


I'll bring them by...


after work.


Okay, what's going on?


Ugh!


Someone's coming.


[Kate] What? Who?


-The businessman.
-Oh!


-Is he stalking you?
-No.


[chuckles] No.
He's actually...


really smart and-and funny
and, and handsome and...


I think you'd like him.


He's, he's more of a inventor
than he's a businessman--


-Mom.
-He's...


I wanna meet him.


-Right. Sorry.
-Yeah.


-I told him that. Basically.
-So, what? It's an ambush?


[doorbell rings]


Ahh-ahh!


-It's the food.
-Ah...


Okay, here,
you take the money,


take the food,
take it all and run.


Okay? Here.


[Diane squeals] Hurry!


Sixty, right?


Fifty-eight, actually.
But I won't take it personal.


-On the house. Hello, Diane.
-Hello.


[whispers] The delivery guy?


[Diane shushes]


The inventor. Uh, Kate, Bruce.
Bruce, Kate.


But I-I think you two, actually,
already know each other.


Triple A.


Yes, I followed
the delivery guy.


Okay. Well, you two have fun.


-Oh. No, she was just leaving.
-Oh-oh! No, no, no. Not so fast.


[instrumental music]


-So, how's Penelope?
-[Diane] Good.


-Who's Penelope?
-[Diane] Juicy.


[Bruce] Their kiss
at the Eiffel Tower?


Chapter five.


[laughs] I called that.


A new memoir just came in.


Um, American woman in Paris.
Lots of lovers.


-We should go to Paris.
-We should.


-Ah... You-you can come, too.
-You didn't think I'd call, huh?


I guess I just didn't really
give it much thought.


I guess I did.
And I thought, what the hell.


And it's been
a hell of a six weeks so far.


-Six weeks?
-[Bruce] Mm-hm.


Six weeks?
It's already been six weeks?


Yes. It's been six weeks.


Yeah, it's six weeks.


I'm, uh, guessing a tiger.


[Diane] Origami something.
[Bruce] No?


-Oh, a swan.
-[Bruce] Ah. Solid guess.


-A flower.
-Oh!


-Oh, it gets me every time.
-Very nice.


[Diane] Kate's amazing
with flowers.


Oh! I have one.


-Oh, this is good.
-Okay. Okay.


[Diane grunts]


[Kate shrieks]


Prepare to be a beast!


[grunts]


[all scream]


-A what?
-Oh!


How did you do that?


[singing in foreign language]


Okay. All right.
I don't really have one.


[both chuckle]


Oh, wait. Wait, wait, wait.


I do. I have one.


-Watch this.
-What's happening?


That's my mom. Why are you...


-Oh! Oh!
-Hm!


Oh! Oh!


[Diane] That...


is an amazing trick.


[both laugh]


No, sorry. Mom wins.
Apple always wins.


Love the apple.
Can't beat the apple.


[laughs]


Oh!


This was fun.


It was.


It was very nice
re-meeting you, Bruce.


-Oh. And you.
-Hm.


Oh.


Oh.


Yes.


Right. Okay.


Okay, bye.


-Bye.
-Bye.


[Bruce] I think she digs me.


-[Diane] She thinks you're nuts.
-She may be right.


[solemn music]


[sighs]


So, will you marry me?


Oh, my God!


[both laughing]


Don't... Don't do that.
Don't do that.


I have never been this...


comfortable, happy...


Oh, my God!
I know... I think I have you.


This is crazy.


Hey, Siri, call Janie.


[line ringing]


[Janie] Hi!


[Kate] I just had dinner
with the businessman.


Ew! Why?


Remember Triple A? Same guy.


[Janie gasps] Stop!


-Yeah.
-That's why she's been so MIA.


-[Janie] How long's it been?
-Six weeks.


I think she feels kinda bad
for the guy.


He seems nice. And he has
no idea what's coming.


They never do.


[Janie] Ooh. I found
what I was looking for.


Okay, bye.


Hi.


[instrumental music]


Hey, Siri, text mom.


Uh, forgot my laundry.
Be there in five.

-What the...
-[Diane] Oh, my God!


Please be a gift card.
Please be a gift card.


-Please be a gift card.
-Oh... Oh, my God! Oh!


[bucket clattering]


Katie?


Katie! Look!


[both squeal]


[laughing]


I couldn't do it
until we met again.


Like, ten minutes ago.


[groans]
You know what we need?


-Champagne!
-Okay. I'm on it.


Are you crazy?
That's an engagement ring!


-I know. Can you believe it?
-Listen. It's okay.


We can fix this. You know...
Mom, mom. Look at me.


It's been six weeks. It is time
you run for the hills.


-I don't think I want to.
-Of course, you do.


You don't wanna get married.
You cherish your freedom.


And, yes, it'll be hard for him
at first, but he'll get over it.


Oh, my God. Wait.


-Are you sick?
-No, Katie, no, no.


-Just calm down.
-Are you broke?


Listen. Let me have it.
Whatever it is I can handle.


Katie, I want this.


[gasps]
Is he blackmailing you?


-No...
-Flutes?


Uh, bottom cabinet,
on the left, behind the bar.


Katie, I get it.


This is a shock, okay?


And in retrospect, maybe
I should have mentioned him


a little bit more,
but, to be honest,


I didn't really know
where it was going--


I'll tell you where
this is going. Nowhere.


But now, it makes complete sense


as to why he was
so pushy, and kind of


insisted on meeting you.


I mean, it's actually
kind of sweet.


Mom, please, think about
what you are saying.


I'm in love.


What?


[solemn music]


I'm in love.


[laughs] Oh, wow, wow!


That feels so good


to be able to say.


I-I wasn't really
looking for it,


but I guess that's probably
the way it goes, right?


You, when you are least
expecting--


To, to Katie,


who set this all in motion.


[chuckles]
Don't blame this on me.

Janie. Leave a message.


Okay.


You are okay.


This is fine.

I can handle this. Yeah.

Am I gonna meditate right now?
I think I'm gonna meditate.


Okay. Here we go.

out through the mouth.


In through the nose...

-[Josh] My freaking luck!
-Oh...


-Ow!
-Oh, my God! Are you okay?


[grunts]


-You almost killed me!
-I know. I'm sorry, I was...


-[Josh] On your phone?
-No.


-I saw you talking. What?
-I was meditating.


-[mumbling] I was meditating.
-I-I can't hear you.


I was meditating.


You were meditating in the car?


I know. I just started.
It's not really working.


-Really helping... Ow!
-Oh, God!


-Are you drunk?
-I wish.


-These are sharp.
-Yeah. I hadn't noticed.


I'm... I'm sorry,
but you came out of nowhere.


And you're basically
camouflaged.


There's a trail right there.


You should wear something
more visible.


I'm sorry, are saying
that this is my fault?


-No, but...
-But what? I should...


Wear a construction vest
next time?


You know, wave a flag,
flashing light?


I don't know.


Maybe.


[chuckles]


You're right. I'm sorry.
I should be the one apologizing.


No. There is an urgent care
in Columbia. Come.


No, it's okay. They are just
scratches, really.


I'm Josh.


This is the part where you
tell me your name. Maybe.


Are you gonna sue me?


No, but you can buy me
a drink, hm?


-Are you serious?
-Yes.


[sighs]


-Fine. Kate.
-Yeah?


One drink.


One drink.


All right.


-So why the meditation?
-Ugh!


My mom just got engaged.


Wow. Daughter of the bride.
That's cool.


As in, cool, not cool.
You know, obviously.


-Have you been to Dylan's?
-You live around here?


Yeah, I'm on Ashland. Do you
know the, uh, the frog mailbox?


That's me.


What's-what's wrong?
Do you hate amphibians?


I didn't buy it.
It-it came with the house.


No? You just... What? Sober?


-Married?
-Uh-uh.


We're neighbors.


Ah!


I'm sorry. What am I missing?


Let's say we get that drink
at our mutual favorite spot.


I'm all freaked out
because my mom's about to marry


a complete stranger,
and a little shaken from


almost committing vehicular
manslaughter.


You're spooked because
you were nearly the victim


of said crime, and not at all
thinking clearly.


-I'm fine though. Really.
-One drink turns into three.


We flirt, swap stories,
swap spit.


-Maybe it's awesome.
-It is. Awesome.


-Maybe sloppy.
-Now who've you been talking to?


We go out a few more times.
Then, around date three or four,


we realize the initial
chemistry has worn off.


Normally, that's fine,


because we'd just ignore
each other's texts


and never see each other again,
but that's not likely since


we live just a few blocks apart
and share the same local bar.


And, well, the thing is,
I really like my apartment.


So, unless you're
willing to move,


I say we call this
whole thing off.


You think there's chemistry.


-That's what you got from this?
-Mm-hm. All right.


Those were all very
valid points. But what if,


we go, we get a couple
of drinks, we swap stories,


swap spit and we discover...
you know,


we have a few things in common
other than our zip code.


We thoroughly established
that neither one of us


is a serial killer
and, in fact, we're...


moderately well-suited
for each other.


And then, you know,
fast forward a bit,


we're telling stories
about the night we met...


you almost mowed down
your future husband.


Or boyfriend of six months. But
either way, that is a classic...


win-win scenario.


You have issues.


I'm an optimist.


Josh...


sorry for the near death
experience.


Kate...


good luck with the wedding.


[chuckles]


[solemn music]


[clears throat]


[Bruce snores]


[Kate] She thinks she's in love.


-[Janie] Maybe she is.
-Janie, there's a ring.


Okay. It's the second ring


that you need to be
worried about.


Do you really think she's gonna
go through with it?


-You're right.
-Mm-hm.


You are totally right.


-I love you! Muah!
-Now, try this.


Breathe in...


breathe out.


Yeah, that, that doesn't work.


Well, just try. See.
They are doing it.

[vocalizing]


[laughs]


Oh! Smells delicious.


It's from the cookbook
you were editing.


You-you left the manuscript out.


-Is this meat?
-You don't eat meat?


You didn't tell me
she didn't eat meat.


No, I do, but she doesn't.


Well, actually,
we were at Bruce's friends


last week grilling...


After sky diving.


You jumped out of a plane
without telling me?


Well, I-I-I didn't wanna
worry you.


And I don't know
if it was like,


if it was like,
a adrenaline rush or what.


Or the ribs that had been
marinating for three days.


You ate ribs?


It was like a primal instinct.


So, all that stuff about
the cute fluffy animals--


Oh-oh-oh. It was organic
and grass fed.


They still kill them, you know.


Well, you've been trying to
get me to eat meat for years.


I'm pushing for lamb chops
at the wedding.


We want to get married,
black tie at The Legacy Castle.


Hm. Sounds expensive.


If I don't fly first class,
my son-in-law will.


-You have kids?
-[laughs] No.


It's just an expression.


[both laughing]


Anyway, Miriam is going to give
us a tour next week.


Don't you think
you're more of a sundress


in the backyard kind of bride?


I eloped the first time around,
this time, I think it'd be


so much fun to just, like,
do it big.


Of course, it is booked through
next September.


-Oh! Bummer.
-That's okay.


It'll just give us
more time to plan it.


Who?


You and me.


Doesn't every mother dream about


planning a wedding
with their daughter?


-I always have.
-No, you haven't.


Well, I dreamt about it
last night.


[Kate] Don't you think this is
all moving a little fast?


[Diane] Katie, I know
this is right for me.


Just like you knew it was
right with the


pharmacist who turned out to be
a drug dealer?


I had no idea. I was having so
much fun until he got arrested.


That part wasn't fun. Okay?
Listen, I know.


I know, I swore


I would never again sleep
with someone who snores.


And God knows, I didn't want a
share a bathroom with somebody,


but I-I realized that's why
they created ear plugs,


and second bedrooms.


Katie, when it's right,
you just work it out.


I'm gonna introduce you
to Evan McMillan.


I don't need you to set me up.


Come on, you set me up.
Look what happened.


Exactly. Since when do you
subscribe to this


societal dictation
that we need to couple up?


I don't. But it is nice to have
someone to share things with.


Hello! You have me.


Kate, do you really wanna be
naked in a hot spring with me?


Hm?


We can't be everything
for each other all the time.


Is this one of your
Tinder rejects?


No. He works with Dr. Markow.


You want to set me up
with your gynecologist?


He's not my gynecologist.


He looks at hoo-haas
for a living.


Well, he is an expert
in his field.


-No, won't do it.
-Come on. He's a catch.


-Think about it?
-Hmm, still no.


So, do I start therapy now,
or wait for it to fully explode?


[both chuckle]


Um, who is that?


Crash victim.


You'd like him.


Yeah.


Kate.


-As predicted.
-We meet again.


I, ah, you know...


-Josh, Janie.
-Hi.


Now, that would be perfect
for walking the trail.


Yes. That's actually
why I bought it.


-Oh, you are a doctor?
-Optometrist.


An optimistic optometrist?


I-I do see things clearly
through rose-colored glasses.


You just come up with that?


No, years in the making.


[chuckles] Wanna join us?


I-I would love to. Um...


-I'm just picking up my supper.
-Mm.


But I guess I will be seeing you
around, after all.


Don't.


I'm sure Kate has
told you already,


but we can accommodate
up to 200 guests.


Oh. Would you excuse me
a moment?


This place is so fabulously
over the top.


It's perfect.
What do you think?


Well, if you love it,
I love it.


[chuckles]


So, July 11th just called off
their wedding.


I have several couples
on the waiting list,


but you guys are family,
so say the word, and it's yours.


-This July?
-[Miriam] Yeah. 7-11.


-It's a very lucky date.
-But that's in three weeks.


-Can we even do that?
-No. No. No.


No, you don't have a dress,
a photographer or an officiant.


-We were hoping you'd officiate.
-Hm?


And do the flowers, of course.


Oh, now, that is lovely.


Three weeks?


Let's do it!


[both laughing]


Get in here. Get in there.


[Diane] I cannot believe
we are actually doing this.


I know. I mean,
three months ago,


I was dodging calls from a guy
in Texas named Smokey.


-Don't ask.
-Now look at you!


Ready to have and to hold,
through thick and thin,


sickness and health,


rain, sleet, snow,
till death do you part.


-No?
-No.


[instrumental music]


[sighs]


[Diane] Come on.


Welcome, and congratulations!
Are you so excited?


This is the best part.
Some water or...


Okay, you're nervous, huh?
Don't be.


Nothing makes a girl
feel more beautiful,


feminine, confident,
graceful, and powerful


than a wedding dress.


-Hmm! Really?
-Mm-mm.


Not financial autonomy?


Or being appointed
at the Supreme Court?


Becoming an astronaut.


-Record going platinum? Mm.
-Ooh! Good one.


Oh, no, no. They are really...


They're beautiful dresses,
they are. They're...


-So pretty.
-[Hailey] Mm.


Do you have a
particular style in mind?


Column, mermaid, princess?


Ooh. How about a
mermaid princess?


Oh, I have just the one!
Let's get your measurements.


Uh, uh, mom...


I want to get you into
the right bra.


The undergarments
lay the foundation--


Mom!


Oh!


Oh!


[laughs] Oh.


Shit!


Oh, ah... okay.


-Hmm, I really need this job.
-No, no, no.


It's okay. I probably should've
said something.


Yeah, I just assumed
since you're...


I mean,
I shouldn't have assumed.


It's just that,
you're the perfect age, so...


You know, we get so many
mothers and daughters


and it's just usually like...
Shut up, Hailey!


-Shut up, right?
-Don't worry about it.


You must be so happy
for your mom.


-Oh, I am.
-Thank you, sweetheart.


I mean, after all those years
being on her own,


she finally has someone
to cuddle with


on the couch
night after night.


They can stroll through
the farmer's market,


nibbling on organic kale...


start all of their
sentences with


"us" and "we."


And, on rainy days,
they can stay in and do puzzles


and make s'mores
in the fireplace.


Because, no matter what,
he will always be there.


-Aww.
-Kate.


I remember all those stories
you used to


tell me about marriage
when I was younger.


Okay, Katie, that's en...


That how draining
and suffocating it could be.


That's true.


How it sucks away your identity


and how the monotony
can be totally unbearable.


-True.
-[Kate] But here we are.


Ring on your finger,
love in your heart.


I'm so glad you finally realized


that none of that stuff
you told me is true anymore.


Me too.


-Who needs a drink?
-Me!


-So, you're not married?
-Oh.


Hard pass.


We should set her up with Kevin!
What's your number?


I'm texting him right now.


-Oooh!
-Ooh!


-So, what do you think, huh?
-[woman 1] Oh!


-[Hailey] Oh, that's pretty.
-Mmm.


You promised power
and confidence. Do better.


You're right.
I'm so sorry.


[woman 2] You've been married
before, right?


How do you know this time
will last?


Till death do us part
is a really long time.


Longer for some than others.


Mm.


I just know my life will be
better with him in it.

I told you it was too much.
Just come help me...

Seat belt, sweetheart.
You good?

And we're off,

Never have I met
two people so different,

Their love is everlasting.


Their love is sacred.


-I don't think I could do that.
-You'll be great.


It's your mom.


Can an officiant
object to the wedding?


[shushes]


Since we spoke all of this,
I was like, I'm done!


-Ah! Congratulations.
-That was so freaking romantic.


Thanks. Okay, my cousin Jim
really wants to meet you.


He's been divorced,
but the marriage was so short.


Like... I don't even
think it counts.


-Hmm.
-What about Chucks?


Hmm.


Oh. I like that pairing
so much better.


Uh, Ben was my college roommate.
Not afraid of commitment.


Good job, great parents.


-But?
-Why is there always a "but?"


Actually, he's got
a really good butt.


[Kate chuckles]


-But, his butt lives in Boston.
-Uh!


-There you go.
-You know what? Whatever!


[Mike] I want to introduce
you to him.

[both chuckle]

-Mostly for the chicken, um...
-Oh.


Can I come in?


Yeah, yeah, of course.
No, I'm sorry, I...


-I'm just gonna... I'll just...
-Um...


-Uh.
-Right. Uh-uh. I, um...


-Hi.
-Hi.


-Here, l-let me help you out.
-Yeah, that would be...


If you just kind of
give it a good kick.


Yeah. Oh!
Oh, that's my slipper.


-Oh, God! Oh, God!
-Hold on.


-Are you okay?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.


[music continues]


-You good?
-[Kate] Yep.


You know you can buy chicken
already butchered, right?


Yeah, but where is
the fun in that?


Why-why is this zipper
so small?


Oh, it's meant to be invisible.
Oh, let's go to the light.


Oh, all right, okay.


-Okay. What are you making?
-Yeah. Uh, chicken paillard.


I, uh,
I challenged myself to cook


six days a week
for six months.


Ambitious.


-Oh, don't pull.
-Sorry, sorry.


I'm trying to be careful.


-Do... do-do you cook?
-Uh, no.


No, I-I-I mostly eat at work.


All right, so are
you an actor or writer...


post grad?


I-I just thought
catering was, you know,


side hustle or gateway job.


-Gateway to what?
-[chuckles] You-you tell me.


-What, what gets you going?
-Is it warm in here?


It's like, feels
a little warm, right?


Are you okay?
Do you want some water?


-I'll get you some water.
-No, it's okay, just...


-Wanna get it off. Yeah.
-Okay.


I... I don't wanna tear it,
though.


It's okay. You know what?
Just pull it.


You expressly told me
not to pull it though.


-Do it! Do it, now!
-Okay. Um, are you sure?


-Fine. All right, there!
-Oh!


I'm a doctor, it's okay.


[instrumental music]


What are these?


[Josh] My favorite thermals?


I mean, they were all the rage.
Circa 2015.


I respect the confidence.
Although, it does feel


a little cliche
wearing your clothes.


Well, I am...


trying to impress
my neighbors, so...


I quite like it.


[both chuckle]


-Have you considered watering?
-Uh, yes.


I have considered it. I, uh...
I have something for you.


All right. Come on.
Through here.


-Okay.
-Right, yeah.


Uh... Here, this magic bag.


-Ah!
-Oh, God, right, okay, so...


We've got a wide selection
of threads, mum.


-Oh.
-We have the crimson red.


The navy blue.
Or, my personal favorite, brown.


-No, white?
-Nope.


Something borrowed,
something blue?


-I love it, genius.
-I'll get that.


Do you mind just holding it?


-Yes.
-Okay. Thanks.


Thank you.


So, what about that drink?


When this goes south,
the pub is mine.


Well, hold on, not so fast.


[clears throat]


Are you sure?
I'm really good.


You can't be good at Rochambeau.


I accept that challenge.


Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.


Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.


It's okay, you can have the bar
in the basement.


Sad bar?


Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.


Have you been in there?
It's a self fulfilling prophecy.


Okay, tiebreaker, hmm?


[exhaling]


[Josh clears throat]


Oh, it's okay.


Guess, we'll have to
make this work.


Mm.


-Thank you.
-Mm-hm.


[sighs]


-The usual.
-Oh. Thank you. Thank you.


-What is that?
-So cool. Vodka lemonade.


-[Kate] It's pink.
-Yeah. And delicious.


-Cheers.
-Cheers.


So...


-Kate.
-Hmm.


Is the fiance
an absolute twit?


My mom is not really
big on commitment.


And you?


-That's direct.
-Yeah.


[both chuckle]


Guess, I've just never really
seen it work out that well.


My parents have been
married for 40 years.


[chuckles]
That explains a lot.


[both chuckle]


What are their names?
Your, uh, mom and fiance?


Diane and Bruce, why?


Diane and Bruce.
Diane and Bruce.


What's happening?
What are you doing?


-You're a genius.
-What's going on?


[clicks finger]


-What?
-Deuce.


-Bam! Deuce.
-What's a...


What's Deuce?


It's-it's-it's their
super couple name.


Come on, you know, you have...
Bennifer.


-Kimye. Brangelina.
-But they're not a super couple.


Well, they are now with that.


I mean, come on,
wedding hashtag "Deuce."


That's the best one I've...
I think I've ever come up with.


That's all.


[both chuckle]


You're a dork.


I will, I will take
that as a compliment.


With my pink lemonade. Hmm.


It's like an,
it's like an Uber service.


[both chuckle]


All right, there, this one.


-Uh! Delivery!
-Oh. Five stars. Thank you.


Five stars.


I'll trade you for the dress.


-Yeah.
-I was-I wasn't gonna ask.


[clears throat] It's her.


Right there. Right there.


Oh. Mm.


Hi!


[Josh chuckles]


Okay. Um, thank you.


Anytime.


[both laugh]


[music continues]


Yeah! Whoo-hoo!


Do you think catering
is a gateway job?


Catering? Well, it's hardly
your life's passion.


Is being a book editor
your life's passion?


I happen to enjoy it. Plus, that
job got you through college.


Why? Are you thinking
of a change?


I don't know, just asking.


Hah! Hey, we've got
that game night,


and tasting
at the Legacy Castle next week.


Do you want me to invite
Evan McMillan?


Vino with the gyno?
No, thanks.


I'll check with Janie.
She loves that stuff.


What's that?


I've been meaning
to talk to you about that.


You're selling our house?


Well, I've been thinking
about it for a really long time.


You didn't tell me.
Why didn't you tell me?


I was waiting
for the right moment.


I didn't find it. Katie...


I don't need all this
space anymore.


Plus, the realtor thinks
I can get a really good deal.


It's our house.
That's my tree.


Aw.


But you haven't lived here
for a really long time.


Plus, I am gonna
be able to start


writing again and traveling.


Don't sell.


Rent it out, you know, just...


-Just in case.
-Katie.


I know this is a lot to stomach.
But now is the time.


It is a seller's market.
Plus, Bruce is on the lake.


So that would be a very
nice change for both of us.


[all laughing]


You, dirty canasta.
I'll get you next time.


-No, no, no, no, no.
-That is showing off.


-You're such a show off.
-Un, deux, trois.


I told Bruce that if he doesn't
impress you guys, he's out.


-Damn straight.
-[Tom] Well...


You do seem like a nice guy.


But, it's time
we beat your ass.


-[laughing] Oh!
-[Marci] Oh, yes!


Tasting with my mom
Thursday night.


I know the whole thing's
super cheesy, but food's good.


And alcohol's free.


Well, I would, but...


Ben's coming.


-Who?
-Chucks.


Really?


You know I'd dropped everything,


but he already
booked his ticket.


Ask crash victim.


He was cute.


[solemn music]


[sighs]


[keys clacking]


[music continues]


[keys clacking]


[phone chimes]


Mmm. I want this.


Caramel, pecan.


-This has...
-Chocolate.


-And this?
-Mmm.


Someone has a date.


-Hi.
-[Bruce] Hi, Katie.


[Bruce chuckles]


-Hi.
-Hi.


-Oh.
-How are you?


Uh, mom, Bruce.
This is Josh, my neighbor.


Ah, so, the infamous Deuce.


-It's a pleasure to meet you.
-How do you do?


-Deuce?
-[Josh] Yeah.


-Deuce.
-[Josh] You'll get there.


Diane, Bruce, Deuce.


-I get it, clever.
-Oh!


-Clever, clever, clever.
-I know.


-Oh, wow, these are good.
-Oh.


Scrumptious, wait...
Is that cardamom?


Yeah, I think with
touch of cinnamon.


-[Bruce] Maybe.
-Oh, yeah.


All right.
You guys ready for some


fun and games
in the ballroom?


-[Bruce] Yeah.
-So, where are you from?


I... Well, see,
I was born in Derbyshire...


[upbeat music]


Left foot, blue!


Left foot, blue,
that's an easy one.


-[Josh] What about those two?
-Oh, kinky for sure.


Y-y-you can't know that.


[Kate] Eyebrow piercing,
leather bracelet.


I bet he's wearing
her underwear.


[Miriam] Right foot, blue.


Wow! How did you know that?


I dated him.


-Really?
-No!


-Years of practice.
-Hmm, right.


[Kate] Your turn.


[Josh] High school
sweethearts, right?


Once a week.
Missionary position.


-Never on Sundays. Mm-hm.
-[sighs] Bleak.


[Miriam] Okay.
You're next.


Welcoming you!
Yes, divas! Here we go.


-Whoo! You're going down.
-[Miriam] Here we go.


[Miriam] Let's start
with right foot, blue.


[whooping]


Right foot, blue, okay.


Left foot, yellow.


-Ah!
-[Miriam] You got it. You got...


-He likes you.
-You sound surprised.


-Where'd you meet?
-Prison.


Oh, I thought
he looked familiar.


Just give him a chance,
would ya?


-No promises.
-[Miriam] Right hand, green.


Right hand, green.


[Josh laughs]


[Bruce groans]


Oh! While you're down there...


[laughs]


we should do this
on our honeymoon.


Winner's the one who doesn't
end up in the hospital, huh?


[Miriam] And now,
we're gonna do left hand, red.


-Left hand, red.
-[woman 2] Ah!


-You're pretty flexible.
-I do yoga.


Ah, too bad we're in public.


Too bad my mom's
right behind you.


[Miriam] Right hand, yellow.


[grunts] Pace yourself, kid.


No big gestures,
no advanced plans.


Get through the thorns,
and you might get some nectar.


-And, she likes pancakes.
-[Miriam] Left foot, yellow.


[Bruce grunts]


-Any kids? Drugs?
-No. No! No!


-Jail time?
-No.


Anything you want to disclose,
now's the time.


Uh...


I cheated in my third grade
Geography test.


You cheat on her,
I kill you.


[Miriam] Right hand, blue.


-My mom's all in.
-Uh, I hope so.


-She's a strong woman.
-I... That's what I love.


You hurt her,
I'll mess you up.


Good to know.


Right foot, blue.


-You're a good sport.
-Yeah, you owe me, big time.


-I bet I can repay you.
-I-I like the sound of that.


[Miriam] Right foot, green.


That's gonna be hard
for you guys.


Oh, man.


We're gonna mix up
these couples here.


You might not leave with
who you came in with.


Maya?


-Josh!
-[Miriam] Left foot, blue.


Uh...


Are you getting married?


Ah, no, you-you?


[Miriam] Left hand, yellow.


My sister, her fiance got sick,
I'm in filling up.


Oh, my G...
Good for her, isn't it?


-You look good.
-[Miriam] Left foot, blue.


[groans]


You do look good.


-Yeah?
-Ah!


[Kate] I should get the
wedding dress.


[Josh] Yes, the dress.
[Kate] Maybe later.


[Josh] Yes, later's good. Yes.


[Kate squeals]


[upbeat music]


[Kate chuckles]


[chuckles]


[Kate] What?


[Josh] Twister injury.


[Kate chuckles]


'Cause you were trying
so hard to impress "the legs."


Legs?


-Oh, yeah, college girlfriend.
-Hm.


It's been a while.


[inhales] Everyone
gets a nickname.


Actually...


what's mine?


Crash victim.


[both giggle]


You've gotta work on that.


[Kate giggles]


[exhales]


-You should probably go.
-Mm-hm.


[solemn music]


[Josh sighs]


[birds chirping]


[instrumental music]


[Josh] Right.


Looks good, looks good,
looks good.


[whooping]


[door opens]


[door closes]


Oh, good morning.
Uh, I don't have eggs.


But I-I do have cereal,
bananas, apples,


nuts, which in all sincerity,
might be bird feed.


Um, but I'm absolutely sure
I can recreate this little


tart from last night, so I say
I could pop down to the store,


pick up some ingredients and we
could make ours at some point.


By the way,
do you have regular days


on and off
at The Legacy Castle?


I work weekdays,
but I'm thinking


I could maybe switch to,
switch to Tuesdays.


I'm really sorry,
but I, I kinda need to go.


All right.


Of course.


[both chuckle]


[upbeat music]


Crap. That's my mom's car.


I will start charging rent.


[chuckles]


Come on.


[door opens]


[Kate] Mom?


Well, well.
Lucky be a lady last night.


I hope you worked up
an appetite.


What's going on?


[Diane] Oh, I just got you
some groceries.


-You were running really low.
-Mom!


[Diane] Katie, I know how upset
you've been lately


with all the changes
that have been happening.


-Why is there a suitcase?
-With Bruce.


-And with the wedding? And...
-What happened to Bruce?


Oh, no, no, it's all good.


The house, sold!


-Amazing!
-Ah!


But they've only given us,
like, a week to clear...


-A week?
-Completely. Yeah!


I know, fast, right?


So I-I put all the big stuff
over at Bruce's


and I just brought my clothing
and my toiletries over here.


I see that, why?


Katie.


I think it would be good
for us to spend some


quality time together
before the wedding.


Hm? Come here.


-Just us?
-Just us. Yes.


No Bruce.


Just us.

Hi.


[chuckles]


Those women are evil.


I guess we'll, uh,
just have to reschedule?


Stop screaming. God!
Take Kate, it's too late.


-You should reschedule.
-Please. Leave me.


-I'm not dancing.
-I have a much better idea.


Nice panties.


-[Bruce] Good one.
-Don't make me laugh.


-[Bruce] Follow me.
-Oh! Don't make me laugh.


And, and don't look
down the water.


Pick a point in the horizon,
a-a tree, don't look down.


And you got this. Go ahead.


I'm finding my Zen.


Okay, okay.


[sighs]


Just stand up, just like
you're standing up anywhere.


But no, no, no.
You, don't look down.


-Oh, God!
-Yeah, you look out, like...


-Okay.
-You know, just standing up.


[solemn music]


[Kate screams]


[Bruce laughs]


Come on! You could do better
than that, come on.


You look like
you're enjoying this.


[chuckles] I am. When you're
using your paddle to get up,


you know that you got
the right width,


if you just do that,
and you can put it on there.


And then you have
the right balance for


when you need to stand up.


Now we can do downward dog.


There you go.


-Okay.
-Yay! Look at you!


-I'm doing it!
-Look at you!


-It's happening. It's happening.
-Sit on the knees.


[music continues]


You're not bringing Josh
to the wedding?


[Kate chuckles]


Hey! He seems like
a nice, young man.


Seriously? You too?


I'm not suggesting
you marry the guy.


[chuckles] Well, I have known
him a month, so...


[Kate chuckles]


This may be your first rodeo,
but it's not mine.


And just for the record...


I was fairly content on my own


when you handed me
your mother's number.


What changed your mind?


Your mother.


[Bruce chuckles]


-She's a hell of a woman.
-[chuckles] Yeah.


[Bruce] Force of nature,
that woman.


-I won't go into details.
-Okay!


[both laugh]


Listen, I've been
all over the world,


I've had plenty
of cool experiences...


One day, I found myself
sitting next to a teepee,


in the Boreal forest, staring up
at the Northern lights.


And for the first time
in my life...


I felt...


peace.


And I remember thinking,


the only thing that would
make this more beautiful


would be have someone sitting
there right next to me...


to share it with.


[solemn music]


-Uh!
-What are you doing?


I want you to keep it.


-No.
-No, no.


It suits you.


Please.


Plus, your mom's
got a lot of stuff.


I gotta start making room.


-There you go. Got it?
-Okay! Yeah.


Wait, wait, wait!
Can't go anywhere without this.


Thank you.


[both chuckle]


-Okay.
-All right, see you later.


-Enjoy it. You did great.
-Thanks.


[instrumental music]


I love this house.


-Me, too.
-Hmm.


-This is... crazy.
-Ah!


Little.


That's what you want, right?


Yeah.


[sniffles] It's still...


a little scary.


[music continues]


Remember that time...


[chuckles] we thought someone
broke into the house


that night,
and so we ran upstairs


and hid in the linen closet.


[Diane] Oh, my!
Armed with only an iron


and-and a box of light bulbs.


[both laughing]


-You were so brave.
-I was freaking out.


But then we couldn't stay
in that closet forever.


Right? Because you had to pee.


Oh, and I definitely peed
in a little


when you ran downstairs
and screamed.


That was the biggest raccoon
I had ever seen.


And then it was, it was,
it was staring straight at us


eating right out of that
trash can right there.


[music continues]


[Diane sighs]


[sniffles]


Bruce is great, right?


-Bruce, you like him?
-Yes.


Yeah, I...


get why you fell for him.


Good.


Because, before
I walk down that aisle,


I need to know that
you're gonna be okay.


[Kate chuckles]


Yeah, mom.


-I'll be okay.
-Okay.


[music continues]


Bye, house.


[door closes]


[bell tolling in distance]


[whimsical music]


[Bruce laughs]


[phone chimes]


[Kate chuckles]


[Kate laughing]


[clacking]


I'm coming for her.


Hm.


[Kate] Did you know pretty much


any adult can perform
a marriage?


I got ordained in ten minutes.


Oh. What about fish?


Do fish have less blood
than chickens?


For example,
that guy right there,


over eighteen, has a pulse...


-Qualified.
-Mmm.


Makes you feel kinda powerful.


Hey, you guys wanna get married?


[Josh] She's not joking.


-Oh, I'll be witness.
-[Kate] Mmm.


No?


I'll marry you right here,


right now in this alley.


I don't think
they're ready, Kate.


Hey.


How's the fish?


Oh, less blood,
but a lot more bones.

You look good in dirt.


I always was more interested
in dirt than dolls.


Oh, well,
I'm, I'm down to get dirty.


-Yeah?
-Well...


[upbeat music]

[Kate] No, no, no. You really

[Josh chuckling] All right.
I'm pushing.

-It's a good trick.

Ooh. Mmm. Oh, fluffy ducks!
I feel good.


[Kate chuckles]


Mm-hm.


Would you mind holding on
to the dress for a bit longer?


It is more than welcome to stay.


In fact, I'm-I'm hoping
it will stay.


I'm hoping it will hang around.


Do you know what I mean?


[sighs]


There's a reptile convention
in town next month.


-Should be interesting.
-[chuckles]


I may not be here.


I'm moving to Boston.


Are you serious?


Well, it's a great city
with amazing opportunities--


Is this about that guy?


Okay, I know you're gonna have
something to say,


so just say it.


You're gonna give up your
apartment, quit your job--


[chuckling] It's not like
I'm living my dream life.


What dream?


[sighs]


To take a leap of faith...


to get out of this town...


see where life takes me.


Do me a favor...


don't insult my dream


if you don't have the courage
to have one of your own.


What does one drink
with pancakes?


Red or white?


Ooh, white.


You know, a guy came in today


with three contacts
stuck in one eye.


It took me over an hour
to get them out.


You've really done a
beautiful job with all this.


[chuckles]
It's just a hobby.


It doesn't have to be.


[wine gurgling]


Come on, we can, we can adult
a little, right?


I talk about my day,
and then you talk about yours...


Do you really believe everything
you said the night we met?


Which part exactly?


Mm, grab a few meals,
share a few laughs,


fall in love,
get married?


-It's, it's just pancakes.
-[Kate] Is it?


Do you actually care about
my mom's wedding?


Or, what I do with my life?


-Yeah, I-I guess I do.
-[Kate] Why?


Because I like you.


[solemn music]


I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. This...


This is my fault. I...
I knocked on your door.


-I, I sent out some signals.
-Are you serious right now?


But I told you I don't believe
in any of this. You know?


-What are you afraid of?
-I'm not afraid, I just...


I don't have those
rose-colored glasses.


I know how this story ends,
so...


I think we should
just end it now


and save us both the trouble.


[music continues]


[sighs]


Okay.


[keys jingling]


[door opens]


Hey.


[Diane laughs]


I am so glad that you're here.


I cannot wait for you
to try these. Mmm!


No, thanks.
Have you seen my shoe?


Uh, no. I wanna put these
on all the tables.


I mean, who doesn't love
a little chocolate after dinner?


-[Kate] I need my shoe.
-Come over here.


I want you try.
I want to know what you think.


I think we need boundaries.


I-I-I meant about
the chocolates--


This isn't normal.


Mothers don't just move in
with their adult daughters.


Well, it's temporary--


They don't just rearrange
their furniture


and change their towels.


Actually, I think
that's pretty standard.


I'm not joking.


Oh, um... I, I didn't realize
you felt that way.


I mean, I-I've just...
I wanted to be close to you.


Well, it's suffocating,
and I need my space.


Well, I mean, I needed your help
with the wedding.


Have you even thought about
how I feel about all this?


I always think about
how you feel.


Huh. Well-well, what about me?


Have you thought about
how I feel?


It's not easy. You know?


I mean, all of this... change.


A-a-and-and moving out and
moving in, and the wedding.


Yeah, but it's all your choice!


Well, it doesn't mean it's easy.


[sighs]


You know, when I was little,
I wanted to be just like you.


Free spirited and independent.


But I'm starting to realize
that you're just


impulsive and careless,


and just make decisions
without thinking about


the consequences or who you
might hurt along the way.


[Kate sighs]


This whole thing's ridiculous.
The wedding.


Unicorns aren't real, mom.


Just like you said,
the sooner you realize that,


the better off we'll be.


I gotta get to work.


[door closes]


[Bruce] Comin' in?


[grunts]


Nice and cold,
the way I like it.


I know. You like it heated.


No, I like it hot.


[both laughing]


[Bruce] We'll have to
sort that out.


Alternate days.


Heated, cold.


Heated, cold.

Phew.

I'm looking for my mom.


Is she here?


She left a few hours ago.


Did you try callin' her?


Yeah, her phone's inside.


[Bruce] Listen.


We had a little...


She may be re-thinking...


everything.


-It's my fault.
-What do you mean?


I told her it was a mistake.


You told her it was a mistake?


Hah. Well, listen.


She's a grown ass woman.


This is on her.


You really think it was
a mistake?


No.


Let's go get her.

[Kate] When I was little,


whenever something went wrong,
we'd go to the batting cages


to blow off steam.


Uh, do you mind if I...?


Oh, no, no. Please.


Yeah.


[exhales]


I had a feeling
I might find you here.


[machine clanking]


[Diane] Yup!


I'm sorry.


I, uh...


I think this whole thing
kinda caught me off guard.


[clanking]


I know the feeling.


I didn't mean what I said.


I just knew exactly
what to say to upset you.


[clanks]


-What if you're right?
-I'm not.


I just had to get used to
sharing you.


I didn't realize that
being with Bruce


would mean
pulling apart from you.


No, I'm not goin' anywhere.


Besides, it's time.


I'm a grown up and...


Bruce is a good one.


-Too good.
-Not possible.


-You deserve the best.
-He's a terrible cook.


Hmm, you make
a mean reservation.


-I need my space.
-He's got plenty.


-I'm scared.
-That's 'cause it's real.


[solemn music]


[sighs]


Katy!


[Diane sighs]


You know, I never wanted you
to grow out needing me.


-I don't think I ever will.
-It's mutual.


Hey, we will always
have each other.


-Mm-mm.
-I love you more.


Hey.


[music continues]


-Hey.
-[Bruce] We good?


[Diane laughing] Yes.


-We are good.
-Yes!


[Bruce] Mm.
[Diane] Mmm.


-We are good.
-Good.


-Aww.
-I'm comin' in.


[Diane laughs]


[laughs]


-Kate.
-Hey.


[Josh] I thought
you were DoorDash.


Oh, no cooking tonight?


-[chuckles]
-[Kate] Umm...


Oh, I just wanted
to finish the job.


Um, you can put them
in the canoe.


-[Kate] Next to the sempervivum.
-Right.


-The purple cabbagey...
-The purple cabbagey ones.


-Right.
-[Kate laughs]


[Kate] Umm...


[Kate sniffles]


The wedding's tomorrow.


Right, yeah.


Wish them congratulations.


I will.


I can't be the guy
you spend time with


only when you
need company, Kate.


I know.


I know.


You know,
your parents, they,


they taught you how to
build a life together.


My mom taught me
I could do it alone.


And I'd like to see it
differently.


I'd-I'd like to fall in love


and get married one day.


I just...


I don't know how.
