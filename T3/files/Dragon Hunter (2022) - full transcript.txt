

Stop.


This way.


Professor Qin.


We're going to die in Mount Kunmai.


I brought you here,


so I must get you out alive.


Let's go.


P-P-


Professor Qin.


Don't talk.


Listen, it's the sound of water.


As long as we follow the sound of water flow,


we can find the exit.

I did it!


[Dragon Capturing Order The dragon mark was spotted in the Mysterious Mountain]


I will avenge you.


Hit!


Mr. Xu,


we've entered the valley of Mount Kunmai.


The valley of Mount Kunmai is extremely dangerous.


Tell them to be quiet.


Don't ruin my plan.


Yes!


I understand.


Hit his head!


Hit his head!


Hit him!


Hit him!


Do you know how to fight?


Tell me something little brother.


What makes those yellow skin monkeys think


they can get the dragon?


I say they only get chance for rabbits.


Glasses,


what did they say?


He said we only could hunt rabbits.


I was born in the year of the rabbit.


I'll fight you!


Let him go!


Go!


Come on! Come on!


How dare you attack me?


I'll kill you!


Beat! Beat him!


What happened?


Let's go and have a look.


-Come on. -Let's go.


-Let's go. -Go!


Kick him off the boat.


What do you think, guys?


Good.


My punches


are tough.


Okay.


Beat him!


Beat him! Beat him!


Beat him!


Beat him!


Master Huo!


Beat! Beat him!


Beat! Beat him!


Master Huo, melt his Dragon Capturing Order.


The less get off the boat,


the more share we can have, Master Huo.


Master Huo!


[Dragon Capturing Order]


Melt it. Melt it. Melt it.


Glasses!


Melt it.


Melt it. Melt it. Melt it.


Master Huo!


Forget it.


F-Forget it.


Forget it.


Sorry.


Mr. Xu treated you well.


He wanted you to use your strength on catching the dragon


not on fighting against each other


when you are full.


Old woman.


The show is over.


Give me one more, please.


What happened?


Grab your weapons!


Mon...Monster!


Go to hell!


Hit him!


Hurry! Go!


Move.


Glasses, are you okay?


I'm fine.


Let's do it.


Well done!


You're indeed a master chosen by me.


But this water beast


is not the target of our journey.


Master Huo, this...we...


Mount Kunmai is surrounded by water


and located in a blocked area.


The dragon originally only committed sins in the mountain


and had nothing to do with you.


But you must have heard of it.


Not long ago,


the scientific researchers I sponsored entered the mountain for scientific investigation,


but they never returned.


I deeply grieved.


So I decided to


give half of my property


to the warriors who could slay the dragon


and get rid of the evil for the people.


-Okay. -Okay.


You finally got to the point.


Mr. Xu is such a kind man.


I'm the only one who can get the reward.


Bravo! Bravo!


Bravo! Bravo!


Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!


Pack your things,


show the Dragon Capturing Order


and get ready to get off.


Come on! Let's kill this god damn dragon!


Don't worry. I'm here.


Shut up if you want to live.


Hurry up!


That woman stole my Dragon Capturing Order!


Come out, bitch!


Come out, bitch!


I don't care who you are


or what you want to do.


I've never seen you before.


Don't bother me.


[Dragon Capturing Order]


Did you hear me?


Return my Dragon Capturing Order!


Don't let me find you.


Or I'll rip your skin out.


Come out now!


Come out!


[Dragon Capturing Order]


What are you doing?


I have the Dragon Capturing Order.


-I have the Dragon Capturing Order. -Let's go.


Throw him down!


The girl stole it.


It was stolen.


Where is your Dragon Capturing Order?


How dare you get on the boat without Mr. Xu's Dragon Capturing Order?


Yu,


this is my closest friend


Qin Xiaofeng, the son of Qin Zhongshu.


Uncle Xu.


I watched Xiaofeng grow up.


He's very interested in minerals,


and he often reads various kinds of books at my place.


Where are we going?


I heard that the evil dragon was huge and liked to stay in the water,


and it was like a snake


which frequently appeared among the bush and woods.


To find the dragon,


we will need to find a wide range of water sources first.


Once you pass through this jungle, you'll reach the Black Pool.


I hope you are all well prepared


instead of never returning back.


Master Huo.


Let's start off now.


Master Huo.


Mr. Xu,


all the people with the Dragon Capturing Order have entered the forest.


I won't go. I won't go.


Master Huo.


We've been walking for so long,


but I didn't see anything.


I need to rest.


-Yes. -I'm exhausted.


I won't go either.


Take a rest here.


Master Huo.


What is this?


Dragon bones.


You've never seen it, have you?


What is this?


Is this the dragon bone?


Let me see.


Leave me alone.


Leave me alone.


What do you know?


Silly boy, you've killed a dragon?


Then you tell me what does the dragon look like.


You've never seen a dragon, have you?


The dragon has such big eyes


and such a big head.


Fine.


I can't say clearly to you


who have never seen a dragon.


I think this is the pork bone.


You little girl...


Master Huo!


Don't be angry.


Stop it.


My goodness.


What the hell is this?


Oh no.


I heard that


anyone who died in Mount Kunmai


would become a ghost.


Then, they will find the next sacrifice to the dragon


to replace themselves.


Ghost?


Ghost? Are you kidding?


Ghost? Is it true?


It'd be great if it's really a ghost.


Maybe it could be our guid.


But this is just an ordinary corpse.


The reason why it appeared here was that


this tree was his grave.


And someone


did obviously worship this tree.


If I'm right,


this should be the local-specific customs and folkways.


Excuse me. Forgive me.


-Okay. We can't stay here for long. -Amitabha.


Let's go.


I'm sorry. I'm sorry.


Glasses.


The deceased is the most important.


Yo.


Baby.


How come?


It looks quite heavy.


Let me help you.


Mind your hands.


What did you find?


The claw print is 60 centimeters long.


The force point is at the back.


This should be


a huge four-legged beast.


So huge?


How huge is it?


At least 15 meters long.


It's like you've seen it before.


Ishida san!


Ishida san!


We will need to get the reward.


What's wrong?


Ishida was lost!


Go to find him!


Yes.


The Japanese was lost!


Ishida!


He's just a Japanese.


Ishida!


He was just lost.


We could get one more share.


He lost his way.


Master Huo, I...I want to pee.


The lazy donkey has a lot of excretion when working.


Hurry up.


Glasses.


-Let's go. -Let's go.


Let's go.


-Let's go. -Let's go. Hurry.


Glasses.


What's wrong?


Dragon!


Dragon!


Dragon?


Where is the dragon?


Don't scare everyone.


I, I really saw it.


Glasses.


Master Huo.


Did you see it wrongly?


I swear that the dragon was right here.


Really?


It's true. I didn't lie to you.


He's not lying. There's a dragon.


Where did it go?


Over there.


It's about time!


Show yourself or I'll blow your god damn forest down!


Come on!


Come on!


Will! Will!


Will!


Will.


Wait!


Okay.


My goodness.


The tree has become a demon.


Back off!


Master Huo, help!


Glasses!


Glasses.


Master Huo.


I told you


I'm here.


Let go of me!


Let go!


How dare you take off my pants!


My goodness!


You owe me big. Let's go.


The sound.


Oh my god!


Little sissy, help me!


Shut up if you want to live!


My goodness.


Hurry up!


Go! Go!


Hurry up.


Go southeast.


We'll soon arrive at the Black Pool.


Let's go.


Go.


Hide yourselves!


Qin!


Get down! Get down!


Qin!


Where are the arrows from?


Qin!


Father.


Xiaofeng.


Watch out!


I saved your life again.


The miasma can cause hallucinations.


You took such a big risk for the reward.


Is it worth it?


Quit with me.


No way.


I will never quit.


I must kill this monster


for my father.


Who cares.


I knew something was wrong with you.


She didn't kill the man. Trust me.


Remember, Mr. Xu asked you here to catch the dragon


instead of finding a girlfriend.


Uncle Xu knows me well.


I never lie.


Qin, I finally found you.


It was not that you found me.


It's that all of us


are trapped here.


San'er!


San'er.


I'm sorry!


I shouldn't have brought you to the boat! San'er!


The compass isn't working.


I heard that


there was a Dragon Forest in Mount Kunmai


where many people were trapped and died inside.


It can't be here!


Oh no!


People outside all say that the dragon is spiritual.


If you offend the dragon, you'll die.


Looks like what they said is true.


Glasses, stop talking nonsense.


Qin, you think of something.


Don't be silly.


What can you do with the Dragon Forest?


I think


we should end this dragon hunting operation.


There might be hopes if we go back the way we came.


The bagua (eight diagrams).


If I were right,


this so-called Dragon Forest


should actually be


a natural bagua.


The Heaven is in the south.


The Earth is in the north.


The Flame is in the east.


The Water is in the west.


The Lake in the southeast. The Thunder in the northeast. The Wind in the southwest. The Mountain in the northwest.


We're in the yin of the yang in the bagua.


The Black Pool is at the Lake's gate.


So, the southeast direction is over there.


What bagua? What yin and yang?


I'll go


wherever you ask me to.


Glasses, let's go.


San'er, please wait for me.


I'll come back for you.


Where is the girl?


Will she be okay?


Of course.


She knows this place much better than us.


What the hell is this place?


Are you okay? Let's go.


M-Master Huo!


It seems to be a dragon.


I-Is it a dragon?


Don't worry.


It's show time!


Come on!


Come on!


Come on!


Come on!


Where are you? Show yourself!


This is the dragon.


Why is it different from what's on the New Year Picture?


Get shot, you beast!


Fire! Fire!


Fuck!


Retreat!


Let's go.


No.


Oh shit!


Glasses.


Hurry.


Run!


-Master Huo! -Come on!


Qin, come and help!


Qin, what happened?


Hide well! Hide well!


Hurry!


Come back! Hurry! Go!


-Xian'er. -Mom.


It seems like that we'll die here.


Go!


Daddy!


Little Stone.


Little Stone.


Go!


Be gentle!


-Let's go. -Hurry!


Chief,


these outsiders disturbed the God of Dragon.


That's why the plague spread.


What plague?


What does the plague have to do with us?


How is the God of Dragon?


The God of Dragon？


The thing you worship as God


is just a monster who eats people.


Qin, look where we are now.


Can you stop talking?


How dare you be so disrespectful!


You'll be sacrificed to the dragon!


Sacrifice! Sacrifice!


Sacrifice! Sacrifice!


Sacrifice!


Chief, Chang is crazy!


Oh my god!


Qin, what is it?


Daddy!


Daddy!


Come back!


Come back!


Daddy.


Come back!


Daddy.


Come back, kid!


Daddy.


Watch out!


Daddy!


Little Stone!


Little Stone.


Daddy!


Chang.


-Qin, are you alright? -Daddy.


It's all because of these outsiders.


Yes, it's all their faults!


We can't let them get away!


We can't let them get away!


Grandpa, what should we do with them?


Hey girl, why are you here?


Chief,


you can't show mercy!


If they hadn't offended the God of Dragon,


Chang and the others


wouldn't have had such a strange plague.


-Yes. -Right, that's on them.


What are you talking about?


-It's all their faults. -Yes.


My brother saved the boy just now.


Grandpa.


He's Qin Zhongshu's son.


Separate them and lock them up.


Yes.


-Let's go. -Go!


Chief!


Hey girl! What do you mean?


-Let's go. -Damn it! You cruel girl!


Who's there?


Tell me.


Where are the others?


How many people do you have


except those survived in the Black Pool?


What's your plan?


I don't know.


What do you mean?


You must have a special relationship with that old man.


Otherwise,


you wouldn't have been allowed to get off the boat


without the Dragon Capturing Order.


Uncle Xu and my father are best friends.


He set up the Dragon Hunting Team


to eliminate the evil dragon.


My father and the researchers entered the mountain


and were all killed by the evil dragon.


Shouldn't I join the Dragon Hunting Team?


Shouldn't he help me?


You kept saying that the God of Dragon killed Uncle Qin.


What's your proof?


Did you know my father?


Of course.


Or why should I help you?


How did you know my father?


Since you asked,


your father saved my life.


Grandpa.


A few years ago,


I got hurt when I was picking herbs by the river.


It was your father who carried me into the village.


Your father was a good man.


He lived here.


Even a good man like him


was killed by your so-called God of Dragon.


Every place


has its own rules.


Grandpa!


I told him


not to bring others into the mountain.


Did he follow the rule?


That won't change the fact


that the beast is fond of killing.


Don't you think it's ridiculous


that you worship a beast as God?


What truly kills you outsiders


is your greed!


My father was not a greedy person.


It doesn't matter that he died.


But he offended the God of Dragon


and it led to the spread of the plague.


There is no god in the world.


A plague is just a plague.


What does it have to do with the dragon?


Of course it does!


My grand-grandfather said


the same plague had happened


a long time ago in this village.


But at that time,


they invited the God of Dragon from the water.


There hasn't been any plague


after the God of Dragon lived in Mount Kunmai.


Outsiders were curious


and they disturbed the God of Dragon.


That was why we closed the village.


Grandpa.


Qin Xiaofeng protected me on the Dragon Hunting Boat


and saved me in the forest.


As long as you cooperate with us


and kick those outsiders out,


I'll spare your and your friends' lives.


I want to find my father first


no matter he's alive or dead.


If you go out now,


the villagers won't forgive you.


You'd better think about


the proposal I just gave you.


Grandpa!


Wait for me!


July, 1922,


I entered the Kunmai Village by accident.


It was like an otherworldly paradise,


full of exotic animals never heard of before.


[Corpse Bug]


The corpse bug, bright-coloured,


highly toxic, easy to invade human minds.


In 1924,


the divine dragon of Mount Kunmai finally showed up,


[Divine Dragon of Mount Kunmai]


the descendant of amphibians,


similar to the dragon recorded in history of Ming Dynasty,


playing an important role in the mountain ecosystem.


But its head as big as a plate


didn't conform to the image in historical materials.


It was gentle in nature,


and irritable when encountering dangers.


Though it was called a dragon by villagers,


the fact was difficult to be verified.


It was a denizen of Divine Dragon Valley


and was suspected to be the source of the plague,


which requires more research.


Father.


Grandpa, the Dragon God is badly injured.


I'm afraid it can't hold on any longer.


I know.


Who untied you?


-How did he come out? -Well...


It's me.


-That outsider's released. -How come...


Chief.


Chief, I agree with your proposal.


Have you figured it out?


Very good.


Go with us.


Don't leave me.


Rong.


Chief.


Rong, is there anything wrong with the Dragon God?


Chief,


we've been following the Dragon God from the Black Pool.


It's very weak now.


Be careful.


What if it holds a grudge?


Don't worry.


Qin!


He did it! The Dragon God is saved!


Kunmai Village is saved!


-The Dragon God is saved.
-Great!


Qin!


We're saved.


Great!


I've saved you this time.


But if you really killed my father...


Qin!


Qin, well done!


Chief,


it hasn't recovered yet.


Where is it going?


If it wasn't for escaping an attack


and running out,


it usually lives in the Divine Dragon Valley.


Divine Dragon Valley?


Yes.


Aren't you looking for your father? Let's go.


Go!


Qin, let's go.


Let's go.


Great!


I knew the Dragon God would be fine.


Let's go back and tell the villagers.


Let's go.


What are you looking at?


That man betrayed us.


He saved the dragon


and entered the forest in the north.


Go after him!


What?


Have you forgotten the consequence of quitting halfway?


Of course not.


We, we won't betray Mr. Xu.


But you said before


even if we just found the dragon,


we'd get a small bounty.


Can you pay for this first?


It's not about money anymore.


What else do you plan to do?


What are you thinking?


I don't think the plague in your village


is a pure illness.


It's more like some kind of poisoning.


Poisoning?


Why is the dragon withering away?


Oh no!


What did you do to the Dragon God?


I didn't do anything.


How could this happen?


It has nothing to do with him.


I think the wound is inflamed.


Inflamed?


I told you.


It's none of my business.


What should we do?


There is heart-piercing lotus nearby.


It can cure inflammation.


Chief, would you please...


I'll go get it.


Master Huo,


I need some water.


So troublesome.


Qin Xiaofeng, what are you doing?


This is the last arrow.


It was meant for you.


But I didn't expect it to be this way.


Stop!


Nitroglycerin.


It can be used as explosives


and also used to promote blood circulation.


Really...


Can it both kill and cure?


Everything in the world has two sides.


To kill or to cure


depends on you.


This is the same as your Divine Dragon.


How is it?


Heart-piercing lotus.


Hurry up.


The heart-piercing lotus is here.


Hurry.


Give it to me.


-Leave these to me.
-Hurry.


Yuling,


this is the first time we've brought others to the forbidden forest.


Yes.


Divine Dragon Valley is right ahead.


Quite vast.


My goodness.


Why are the fireflies so big?


Qin, look!


Watch out!


Qin Xiaofeng, your hand...


Grandpa.


Are you okay?


Qin, look!


Let's go.


-Go!
-Let's go.


Hurry!


Grandpa.


Qin.


What should we do?


Plague! Plague!


Oh...


-It's not a plague.
-Grandpa, do something!


Qin Xiaofeng!


Qin Xiaofeng!


Qin!


I can't stand it anymore.


Just let me die.


Don't talk nonsense. You'll be fine.


Qin Xiaofeng.


I told you.


Dragon God is our god.


As long as it's fine,


there will be no plague.


Qin,


you won't die.


How do you feel?


I'm much better.


That's good.


Chief,


I think I've found the source of the plague.


Corpse bugs are poisonous.


If people are bitten,


their nervous centralis will be damaged,


driving people insane.


This may be the cause of the plague.


The dragon lives off corpse bugs,


thus it can confine bugs


in Divine Dragon Valley.


The dragon can protect you,


but it has no divine power.


This is called ecological balance.


Ecological what?


I don't understand.


All I know is that the dragon


has protected us.


But it will also experience sickness and death.


We have the responsibility to protect it.


You're right.


I was wrong.


You were blinded by hatred.


You rest here.


I'll go check on the Dragon God.


Okay.


Why are you looking at me?


Nothing.


I just think you really look like your father.


Why don't you ever mention your parents?


My parents


died when I was very young.


Grandpa brought me up.


Your father must love you very much.


So you're so desperate to find him.


I'm leaving.


Wait.


I'll send you there after finishing reading.


All you know is research.


I'll send you now.


Don't bother.


Xiaofeng! Xiaofeng!


Xiaofeng.


I owe him an apology.


Your father treats you very well.


He always talks about you.


He said you are the most important person to him.


He's very proud of you.


Qin,


how's your hand?


I'm fine.


If it weren't for you,


I would have been bitten.


I'm fine now.


Qin, I want to confess something.


Confess?


What did you do?


Come and help me.


Nothing.


I'll go get some firewood.


Chief.


Take them all.


You're kind of weak.


What did he want to say?


How did you find this place?


Anyone who quits halfway


will die.


Glasses.


Where is Glasses?


What did you do to Glasses?


Master Huo, thank you.


How dare you betray us!


I...


I wanted to tell you.


What do you mean?


Mr. Xu's target is the dragon.


We can't do harm to them.


It seems that Uncle Xu


didn't receive our notice.


Where is Sheng?


Are you talking about him?


Sheng.


You acted on your own.


Uncle Xu won't let you off.


Who acted on his own?


Uncle Xu.


Xiaofeng.


Don't be fooled by these barbarians.


Your father was deceived by them


and became the prey of this evil dragon.


What are you talking about?


No.


We can't kill the dragon.


Otherwise, corpse bugs will destroy the whole village.


Everyone in the village will get hurt.


Xiaofeng,


I'm so disappointed in you.


It seems


I have to be the one


who avenges your father.


Protect Mr. Xu.


Go!


Get them!


Get them!


Grandpa! Grandpa!


Be careful.


The Dragon God is still injured.


Hurry to follow up.


Leave me alone!


Grandpa, no!


-Go! Hurry!
-Go!


Grandpa, hurry!


You're dead meat.


How dare you ruin Mr. Xu's plan?


You're really asking for death.


Stop!


Chief, look carefully.


Who I am.


You are Xu... Xu Sanman?


The temple is on fire!


God offenders will come to no good end.


How could this happen?


How come?


You never thought it's me, right?


You're from Kunmai Village.


You knew the dragon is our guardian,


but you want to kill it.


Our...


When you kicked me out,


why didn't you think of my thoughts?


You caused the trouble.


We sent you out of the village


and gave you enough money.


We've done my best.


Your best?


For a beast,


you drove a child away.


Do you know


how I survived all these years?


Are you coming back for revenge?


I just want to live.


Didn't you say


the dragon heart can cure all diseases?


You will be punished if you kill a dragon.


Then I'll show you


your punishment.


I'm sorry, Chief.


It's all my fault.


Sheng and the Chief died for me.


It's not your fault.


All of this was Xu Yuansheng's trap.


We should set off.


Send the dragon back first.


There might be a misunderstanding.


Let's go.


It's so beautiful.


This must be its home.


It's my first time here too.


It's safe for now.


Stay away for a while.


What about you?


I need to find my father.


Divine Dragon Valley is massive. I'll go with you.


Okay.


What is this?


Wait.


Was the dragon attacked here?


Well...


Mr. Qin.


Father.


Xu Yuansheng!


Oh no.


Qin.


I'm sorry for your loss.


Why did you kill my father?


I didn't want to kill him.


He asked for it!


What the hell are you doing?


Zhongshu, I want to kill the dragon to get the heart.


Liar! You're a liar!


Zhongshu.


So this is why you approached me.


I'm terminally ill.


Can you bear to see me die?


Think about it.


The money enabled Xiaofeng to go abroad.


The research fund for you all these years.


Who paid for all these things?


Right now, only the dragon's heart can save my life.


The dragon is the important ecological closed-loop for Mount Kunmai.


I won't let you hurt it no matter what.


Qin Zhongshu!


Are you trying to kill me?


Then don't blame me for being rude.


How dare you!


I'll fight it out with you!


Qin Xiaofeng!


Qin Xiaofeng!


Qin, I'm sorry.


They said they would give me money,


so I left marks all the way.


It was a moment of madness.


I also harmed Glasses.


Time is running out.


Come with me.


Qin!


Qin Xiaofeng, what are you doing?


Revenge!


It's urgent to save the dragon now.


Have you forgotten how Mr. Qin died?


Just like my grandfather,


Mr. Qin did everything to protect the dragon and the villagers.


If you go there now, you'll die.


By then, including the dragon,


none of us can survive.


Xu Yuansheng killed my father.


I want him to pay with his own life!


Qin!


We can't let Mr. Qin and grandpa's sacrifice be in vain.


Then what should we do?


Goodness!


This is no time


for you two to dawdle.


Come on and have a discussion.


How can we fight with so many people?


It's not impossible.


We have a weapon


that they don't hold.


God of Dragon?


The day I long for finally comes!


Now, there is no place you can hide.


Have the bombs been primed?


Yes.


Stick to the plan.


What plan?


Damn it!


Get the gun mount ready!


Hurry!


Mr. Xu, everything is ready.


Xu Yuansheng!


Leave her alone.


Fire!


Missed.


Mr. Xu, what should we do?


If we can't catch the dragon,


all of you will die with me!


Hurry, reload the bomb!


Fire!


We got it!


We got it!


Let's go.


Be careful.


Qin Xiaofeng!


Qin!


Let's go.


Go over there.


How dare you


be against me?


Perish the thought.


Bastard!


Bastard, come out!


Qin Xiaofeng!


Let's go.


Mr. Xu, let's go.


I was nearly killed, Qin.


Are you okay, girl?


Don't let him run away. Go after him.


Get after him. I'll stall him.


Okay.


Go to hell!


Stall them!


Be careful.


Mr. Xu!


Yu!


I'll bury you all here!


After you die,


I'll come back to dig out the dragon's heart.


You came at the right time.


It'll save me the trouble of


finding you bastards


when I return to dig the hole!


God of Dragon! God of Dragon!


Grandpa has passed away.


You can't die.


Kunmai Village...


There's no guardian god in Kunmai Village anymore.


God of Dragon.


God of Dragon.


Qin! Qin!


Look what I found.


Dragon egg.


Qin.


Why did you call us here in such a hurry?


Little girl,


Qin is so anxious.


Nothing good ever happens when he calls us.


My goodness.


What does it say?


[Come quickly]


Mysterious beast!


It looks like we have a new mission.


What is it?


Qin.


Little girl,


you're the village head now.


If you keep running out like this,


what about Kunmai Village?


It doesn't matter.


There is a new guardian god


in Kunmai Village.


Then before it grows up,


I can bully it


with my big fists.


I'll keep that in mind.


I'll tell it when it grows up.


Qin, you didn't learn anything this time


except being more garrulous.


I was the one


who protected you two when you were in danger.


Little girl, you protected who?


You silly boy.


Our mission is very dangerous and extraordinary.


Hurry up.


Slow down. We must be careful.


It's okay. My fists can protect us.


Come out, kid.


It's not here.


Did you find it?


-No. -It's not here, either.


Everyone, be careful.


Look everywhere.


-OK. OK. -Okay.


Let's go.


Where do we go?


Over there.
