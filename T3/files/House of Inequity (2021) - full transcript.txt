to be treated like that.

[scoffs] Act like you beat me up
and took my stuff.


I just wish
I was there for you sooner,


or drove you to school.


Well, on the bright side,
you've, uh...


got the whole day off.


Let's do something.
What do you say?


I just kind of
wanna stay here.


I could take you bowling.
We could go to the beach.


Or what's, uh--
what's that hero movie


at the cinema
you've been wanting to see?


Dragon Fist.
The fire-punching crime god.


Dragon Fist the what?


What, did they run out


of superhero film names
or something?


It sounds
childish and stupid.


Then I grabbed him
by his ear.


And picked him up
with his two friends.


I said, "Hey, man,
Denny's cool, man.


And I'm going
to fuck your sister."


Come on, I'll take you.
We'll make a whole day of it.


[Denny sighs]


I don't need pity
to soothe a busted ego.


You've got
to want to do something.


Let's make
the most of the day,


you can play
on the computer later.


[Miles] What's up?


Trying to convince
Denny here, said,


"Get off the computer and come
do something fun with us today."


Let's do it.
We should go fishing.


Fishing?


[Miles] Come on, Danny,
let's go.


Go where?


Whore house?


Come on,
let the kid pump out some rage.


-What?
-We're trying to cheer him up,


not make him
hate himself more.


Dragon Fist
is playing in the cinemas.


Look, guys,

got posted up today about


a creepy mystery house,
and now everyone


in the community
wants to know more about it.


[Miles] So, why are you typing?


Do you know about this
fucking house or something?


No, I just said
that I live near it


and now everyone's
asking me questions.


What does it look like?


Well, there's an old photo from
back in the day, but that's it.


No modern updates,
just myth and legend.


Well, how close?

-Wisconi?


That's not that far.


It's a few hours' drive
in the country.


Would you get
some good internet karma


if we went there
and took some photos?


Of course.


If I actually delivered
on this post,


I'd basically
be a hero on this forum.


Well, let's do it.


We can jump in the car
and drive out there.


Hell yeah. Road trip.


Really?


What about your assignment?


Yeah, well,
we can drive out there.


You can shoot some photos.


We'll be home tonight
and I'll finish my assignment.

-Let's go on a road trip.
-Mm.


Hey, do you know exactly
where it is


or we gotta look for it?


Nah, I can ask the OP for
exact address and directions.


Wait,
what the fuck's an OP?


Original poster.


Can send him a message


and ask for coordinates
and directions from the house.


Sounds good.


-Road trip it is.
-I'll tell the girls.


I'll get changed.


I'll roll

Could get a little cold

-Dad's lucky jacket.
-Of course.

road trip vehicle.


Will that
even make it?


This...


is a palace on wheels.


That's the "Yes, we can" van.

Yes, we can... smoke weed
in a school car park.


Yes, we can... sex with
the checkout girl at the shops.


Yes, we can.

Yes, it can.


Possibly not get you

Yes, it can.


Be the sole reason

depression and suicide?


[both] Yes, it can.


We'll see.


This van is kickass.


See, even your lady
digs the van vibes.


What do you think, Rose?


We'll work on that.


[Henry] What?

I used to train him at my gym.


Hey, Dean.


-You rob a bank?
-[Dean panting] No.


I'm in a hurry to get

Mum and my grandma
live out there.


We're headed out
that way.


Yeah, jump in with us.


Well, where you guys headed?


Uh, Wisconi.


It's like 20 minutes
from Virino.


[sighs]


-Is-- is there room?
-Yes, there is.


Jump in,
the road palace awaits, my man.


For good luck.

I'm sorry.


Don't be.


It's my fault.


It's all my fault.


It's my fault
we came here.


-Now everyone's dead.
-Hey, listen to me.


It's not your fault, okay?


It's not your fault.


Come here.


You mean
everything to me, Den.


I'd give my life
for yours in a heartbeat.


I'll get you
out of this house.


No matter what.


I promise.


Hey.


I will get you
out of this house.

Ever since Dad died...


you have been
so much more


than just a brother to me.


So much more.


Dad was my hero.


He's my--
my anchor in the storm.


To me,
there was no safer place


in the world
than in his arms.


He could make
any situation better.


I miss his laugh.


His intelligence.


His heart.


I miss him, too.


I felt like
I had no value.


No hope, no strength.


No security.


But you put aside
everything


to fill
that void in my life.


You became my anchor.


I'll always miss Dad.


But because of you...


that-- that emptiness...


that filled my life...


is gone.


I love you.


I love you, too, Den.


[bell ringing]


Den, listen to me.


We both need to
get through that door


at the same time.


Remember how we used to
run down the hall at home?


Den, you can do this.


Remember?


Yeah, I-- I remember.


[Denny sniffs]

Let's talk about it
on the way home.


Come on. It's time to get
the fuck out of here.

We're going straight

I can help you

You can go

You don't need that
with me.


So...


you ready to go home?


Look under the door.


Your night is complete.

You. You killed them.


I'd be wise

You can go home.


Yeah, I'll just go home.


Like no one I know
died here tonight.


Nah.


There's one more death
to happen yet.


You might be correct, Henry.


However...


tonight wasn't about death,


so much
as it was about fear.


Fear was your enemy.


We just facilitated it.


Fear killed everybody.


Not me. Fear.


What about me, huh?


I'm feeling pretty fearless
right about now.


Well, adrenaline, a gun.


Yeah, I can believe that.


But give it time.


It's a slow burn.
Life, you know?


You killed my brother,


Jessie, my friends.


Not me.
Where's my fear?


Walk out the door, Henry.


Go live your life.


Let old age take you.


But you want to know
the real stinger?


What you saw
here tonight,
